<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.3</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-december-4-2017---visual-studio-2017-version-73-730797">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Quick Fix &ndash; Install System.ValueTuple NuGet Package</h2>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/08/24/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/">C# 7.0 introduced tuple types</a>
that may require the System.ValueTuple NuGet package
to be added to the project. Visual Studio for Mac
now offers to install the System.ValueTuple NuGet package if the project requires this NuGet package.</p>

<p>Creating a .NET Framework 4.6 project with the following code:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>public (string, int) GetValues(string id)
{
    return ("Name", 25);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You will see error markers in the text editor. If you hover over
one of these error markers you will see a
<strong>Predefined type &lsquo;System.ValueTuple`2&rsquo; is not defined or imported</strong> message.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/ValueTupleTextEditorErrorTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;ValueTuple type not defined text editor error tooltip&rsquo; &lsquo;ValueTuple type not defined text editor error tooltip&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you right click the error marker there is now a new
<strong>Install Package &lsquo;System.ValueTuple&rsquo;</strong> Quick Fix action available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/TextEditorInstallSystemValueTuplePackageQuickFix.png" title="&lsquo;Text editor Install System.ValueTuple Package quick fix menu item&rsquo; &lsquo;Text editor Install System.ValueTuple Package quick fix menu item&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>From this menu you can install the latest System.ValueTuple NuGet package
or open the Add Packages dialog to search for a specific version of the System.ValueTuple NuGet
package.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/TextEditorInstallLatestSystemValueTupleQuickFix.png" title="&lsquo;Text editor install latest System.ValueTuple package quick fix menu item&rsquo; &lsquo;Text editor install latest System.ValueTuple package quick fix menu item&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that if the project is targeting .NET Framework 4.7 or .NET Standard 2.0 then the
System.ValueTuple NuGet package is not required.</p>

<p>Also note that the official nuget.org package source needs to be available
for this feature to work.</p>

<h2>NuGetizer 3000 &ndash; Updated NuGet.Build.Packaging to version 0.2</h2>

<p>The version of the NuGet.Build.Packaging NuGet package used by default for NuGetizer 3000 support
has been updated from 0.1.276 to 0.2.0. This fixes a
potential build error when building with Mono 5.6.</p>

<p><code>

<p>The ReadLegacyDependencies target from NuGet.Build.Packaging.Tasks is called when PackOnBuild
is set to true.</p>

<p>The NuGet.Build.Packaging.Tasks assembly was loading an embedded NuGet.ProjectModel
assembly that conflicts with the version that is used by Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild property is
read and appended to the list of fallback folders stored in the
project.assets.json file. The .NET Core 2.0 SDK will set this
MSBuild property to point to the NuGet package fallback folder
that is installed with the SDK. This will be used
to resolve NuGet packages first before downloading them to the
~/.nuget/packages folder.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property can be used
to add additional package sources to the existing list of sources
used to resolve packages.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild property can be used by project that uses
PackageReferences to define a set of package fallback folders that
will override any specified in the NuGet.Config file. It can also
be used to clear any pre-defined fallback folders by specifying
&lsquo;clear&rsquo; as its value. Note that this value does not affect any
folders defined by RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders which
will be appended even if RestoreFallbackFolders is set to &lsquo;clear&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Support RestorePackagesPath MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestorePackagesPath MSBuild property can be used to override the global packages
folder location when a project uses a PackageReference.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreSources MSBuild property</h2>

<p>The RestoreSources MSBuild property can be used to override
the sources defined by any NuGet.Config file. Any sources defined in the
RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property will still be appended to the
list of sources if RestoreSources is defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Transitive dependencies not available when using project.json</strong></p>

<p>With two projects A and B that both use project.json files, project B
referencing project A, the NuGet package dependencies used by project
A were not available to project B transitively. This was because the
project reference information was not being used
when a restore occurred. This caused the assemblies from the transitively
referenced NuGet packages to not be added to the
project.lock.json file for Project B.</p>

    <updated>2017-11-12T14:30:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2017/11/12/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-template-creator-addin">Template Creator extension</a> provides a way to create a project template from an existing project
or solution open in Visual Studio for Mac and have the project template available in the New
Project dialog straight away.</p>

<p>The Template Creator uses the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating">.NET Core templating engine</a>
to create the projects from the project templates.</p>

<p>Let us take a look in more detail at what the Template Creator extension provides in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> Create a project template from an existing solution or project</li>
<li> Create custom top level project template categories</li>
</ul>


<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Mac 7.0 or later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating a new Project Template</h2>

<p>To create a new project template for a project opened in Visual Studio for Mac,
right click the project and select Create Template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/ProjectCreateTemplateMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Project &ndash; Create Template context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Project &ndash; Create Template context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A Template Information dialog is then opened.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplateInformationDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Template Information dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Template Information dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The information in the dialog is used to populate the generated template.json file. Further
details on what the template.json file holds is available in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/Reference-for-template.json">reference for template.json</a>].</p>

<ul>
<li>Author

<ul>
<li>Author of the project template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display Name

<ul>
<li>This is the template name displayed in the New Project dialog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Description

<ul>
<li>This is the description displayed in the New Project dialog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Category

<ul>
<li>This is the category in the New Project dialog used by the template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Short Name

<ul>
<li>This is the short name for the template that can be used from the .NET Core command line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default Project Name

<ul>
<li>This is the default project name that will be used with the .NET Core command line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identity

<ul>
<li>This is the unique id for the template. This should be unique across all custom
project templates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group Identity

<ul>
<li>This is typically a substring of the template&rsquo;s Identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>By default the project template will use the Other &ndash; .NET &ndash; General category in the
New Project dialog. To change the category click the browse button next to the category text
box to open the Template Categories dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplateCategoriesDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Template Categories dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Template Categories dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Select the required category and click OK. The selected category will then be updated
in the Template Information dialog.</p>

<p>Click OK to generate the template.json file. The template.json file will be opened
in the text editor. It will also be displayed in the Solution window in the
.template.config folder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/ProjectTemplateJsonFile.png" title="&lsquo;template.json file created for project&rsquo; &lsquo;template.json file created for project&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The project template is now available in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/CustomProjectTemplateInNewProjectDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Custom project template in New Project dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Custom template in New Project dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Updating a Project Template</h2>

<p>After the project template is created you can modify the original project and its
template.json file as required.</p>

<p>Changes made to the project are available in the New Project dialog immediately.</p>

<p>Changes made to the template.json file are available immediately in the same
instance of Visual Studio for Mac where the template.json file is being edited.</p>

<h2>Multiple Projects in a Template</h2>

<p>A project template may create more than one project. To create a project template
for all projects in the solution right click the solution and select Create Template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/SolutionCreateTemplateMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Solution &ndash; Create Template context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution &ndash; Create Template context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A template.json file will be created in a .template.config directory inside the solution&rsquo;s
directory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TwoProjectsTemplateJsonFile.png" title="&lsquo;template.json file created for soluton&rsquo; &lsquo;template.json file created for solution&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that in order for the new projects created to use the name specified in the New Project
dialog they should all have a common start to their name. The template.json file&rsquo;s <code>sourceName</code>
will be the part that is replaced with the name of the project specified in the New Project dialog.</p>

<h2>Configuring Registered Project Templates</h2>

<p>The .NET Core templating engine supports project templates in NuGet packages or project templates
that unpackaged in a directory. The Template Creator extension does
not package the project templates into a NuGet package and instead stores a set of directories that
are scanned by the .NET Core templating engine for templates. The set of directories that are
registered can be viewed and updated in the Preferences dialog from the Templates &ndash; Custom Folders section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/PreferencesCustomFolders.png" title="&lsquo;Preferences dialog &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Folders&rsquo; &lsquo;Preferences dialog &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Folders&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The templating engine will scan the configured directories and look for all the template.json files
which define the project templates. The project templates found are then made available to the
Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;s New Project dialog by the Template Creator extension.</p>

<p>When the template.json file is created using the information in the Template Information dialog
the Template Creator extenxion also registers the
project&rsquo;s directory so it will be scanned by the templating engine.</p>

<p>To remove a project
template from the New Project dialog you can either delete the template.json file or
remove the folder from the Custom Folders defined in the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p>If you have an existing set of project templates that use template.json files and are not
in a NuGet package then you can register a single parent directory in the Preferences dialog.</p>

<h2>Custom Categories</h2>

<p>Custom top level categories can be defined for your project templates by adding them in
Preferences &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Categories.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/PreferencesCustomCategories.png" title="&lsquo;Preferences dialog &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Categories&rsquo; &lsquo;Preferences dialog &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Categories&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The Add Top Level Category button will add a new top level category and two child category
levels. The New Project dialog requires three category levels. The ids used should ensure that
the full path to the template&rsquo;s category is unique. For example, with a custom category
<code>custom/net/general</code> there should not be another top level <code>custom</code> category id, but the second
and third level category ids can be re-used in another top level category, such as <code>top/net/general</code>.</p>

<p>The Add Category button will add a single child category to the currently selected category
whilst the Remove button will remove the selected category.</p>

<p>Note that changes to the categories require Visual Studio for Mac to be restarted before they
are visible in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p>Also note that it is not currently possible to extend existing project template categories
using the Template Creator extension.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Template Problems</h2>

<p>If the template does not appear in the New Project dialog or fails to be created then
you may be able to diagnose the problem by opening the Templating Log window. This is
available from the View &ndash; Pads menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/MainMenuViewPadsTemplatingLog.png" title="&lsquo;Main menu &ndash; View &ndash; Pads &ndash; Templating Log&rsquo; &lsquo;Main menu &ndash; View &ndash; Templating Log&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This window will show messages returned from the .NET Core templating engine and any errors
reported by the Template Creator extension.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplatingLogWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Templating Log window&rsquo; &lsquo;Templating Log window&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Template Creator extension is available to download from <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-template-creator-addin/releases/download/0.1/MonoDevelop.TemplateCreator_0.1.mpack">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To install the extension open the Extensions Manager by selecting Extensions&hellip; from the main menu. Click the Install from file button. Select the .mpack file and then click the Open button.</p>

<p>The extension is also available from a <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-addins">custom MonoDevelop 7.0 extension server</a>. It is not currently published to the main Visual Studio for Mac extension gallery.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Support NuGet package fallback folders</li>
<li> Support AssetTargetFallback</li>
<li> Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support (VS for Mac 7.2.2)</li>
<li> Fixed transitive types from references not being available</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.2</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-october-9-2017---visual-studio-2017-for-mac-720636">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet package fallback folders support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core SDK 2.0 defines a NuGet package fallback folder <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder</code> that can be used when looking
for NuGet packages whilst restoring. This fallback folder is now supported by
Visual Studio for Mac 7.2 so that on restoring a .NET Core 2.0 project the NuGet
packages from the fallback folder will be found and do not need to be downloaded from nuget.org into the
local machine NuGet package cache <code>~/.nuget/packages</code>. This should speed up NuGet package restore for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 projects the first time it occurs.</p>

<p>As well as the NuGet fallback folders Visual Studio for Mac will now add the following items to the generated project.assets.json
if they are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>configFilePaths</li>
<li>sources</li>
<li>warningProperties</li>
</ul>


<h2>AssetTargetFallback support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses an AssetTargetFallback MSBuild property
defined in an imported SDK MSBuild files. This is used instead
of the PackageTargetFallback property when determining if a NuGet
package is compatible. Currently the AssetTargetFallback property
is set to net461 by the .NET Core 2.0 SDK which allows .NET Core projects to use NuGet
packages that include assemblies that target the full .NET Framework.
The supported fallback frameworks are now added to the generated
project.assets.json file by Visual Studio for Mac when a .NET Core 2.0 project is restored.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore now fails if package and asset target fallbacks are defined by a project</h2>

<p>If both AssetTargetFallback and PackageTargetFallback are defined by a project then the
NuGet restore will fail with an error indicating that they cannot
be used together. This mirrors the behaviour of the .NET Core command
line restore.</p>

<h2>Mark implicit PackageReferences as auto referenced</h2>

<p>PackageReference items that have IsImplicitlyDefined set to true
in their metadata now have autoRefererenced set to true in the project.assets.json file.</p>

<h2>Support parsing MSBuild conditions with unquoted properties</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses conditions that pass properties to the
Exists function without using single quotes around the MSBuild property.
This is now supported by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="Exists($(FileName))"&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support</h2>

<p>The following sections cover bug fixes made in Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.2
to improve support for <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/xamarin-forms/xamarin-forms-2.4/2.4.0-stable/">Xamarin.Forms 2.4</a> and later versions. Xamarin.Forms 2.4 includes .NET Standard support as well as defining default MSBuild items for
.NET Core and .NET Standard projects. These default MSBuild items were not
handled by Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.0 and earlier versions. The main symptoms of Visual Studio for Mac not supporting Xamarin.Forms 2.4 were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicate .xaml files in the Solution window.</li>
<li>Nesting of .xaml and .xaml.cs files not working in Solution window.</li>
<li>MSBuild items incorrectly added to SDK style projects.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Generated NuGet files being imported twice</h3>

<p>The generated NuGet files, .nuget.g.targets and .nuget.g.props,
that are created for .NET Core projects were being imported twice.
Once by Microsoft.Common.props, that is provided with Mono, and once
by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>This double import was causing a duplicate file
to be added to the
project when Xamarin.Forms 2.4
was used in a .NET Standard project and the .NET Core SDK was not
installed. This would result in the .xaml file and associated
.xaml.cs file not being nested in the solution window.</p>

<h3>MSBuild items added when new xaml file added to project</h3>

<p>Adding a new Xamarin.Forms content page with XAML would incorrectly add an
update item to the project for the .xaml.cs file when an SDK style project
was used.</p>

<p>When a new .xaml file was added to an SDK style project a None item as well as an EmbeddedResource item would incorrectly be added to the project file.</p>

<p>```
<None Remove="MyView.xaml" /></p>

<p><EmbeddedResource Include="MyView.xaml">
  <Generator>MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXaml"</Generator>
</EmbeddedResource>
```</p>

<h3>Compile item added with DependentUpon metadata</h3>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines a wildcard update similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When a project was saved in Visual Studio for Mac a Compile item was
incorrectly added to the main project with the evaluated value stored in the
DependentUpon element.</p>

<h3>DependentUpon being evaluated incorrectly</h3>

<p>Metadata defined for wildcard MSBuild items were being evaluated using
the wildcard item instead of the expanded item. This
was causing .xaml.cs files to not be nested in the Solution window
for Xamarin.Forms 2.4.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines an update item similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The DependentUpon property was evaluated using the wildcard item
which resulted in the DependentUpon property being
evaluated as &lsquo;*.xaml.cs&rsquo; instead of the filename of the item that was
updated by the wildcard.</p>

<h3>Define MSBuildSDKsPath for MSBuild engine host</h3>

<p>MSBuild when run on the command line defines the MSBuildSDKsPath in
its MSBuild.dll.config file. The MSBuild engine host that is used
when building with Visual Studio for Mac now also defines the MSBuildSDKsPath property. Previously this was not being defined.</p>

<p>This fixes a build error when using Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 in an SDK style
project that targets .NET Standard. Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 uses default
item imports which were not being included since they are conditionally
imported based on the MSBuildSDKsPath property value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Forms.DefaultItems.props" 
    Condition="'$(MSBuildSDKsPath)'!=''" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the SDK style project had a .xaml file and a .xaml.cs file then
the .xaml.g.cs file was not being generated when the project had no files
explicitly defined in the project file. This
then caused a build error about the InitializeComponent method not
being defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive assembly references not available until restart</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC
references LibB which references LibA. If the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet
package was installed into LibA the types from this NuGet package
were not available in LibB or LibC until the solution was closed and
re-opened again. Closing and re-opening the solution refreshes the
reference information used by the type system. Now when a NuGet
package is installed into a .NET Core project the projects that
reference this project have their reference information refreshed. Types from
the installed NuGet packages are then available in projects that
reference this updated project either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive project references after editing a project file</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC references
LibB which references LibA. If a NuGet package is added to LibA by
editing its project file in the text editor the types from this NuGet
package were not available to LibB or LibC without restarting Visual Studio
for Mac or until the packages were restored for the solution. Now when the project file
is saved the projects that directly or indirectly reference the project
will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore project references with ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false when restoring</strong></p>

<p>Project references that have ReferenceOutputAssembly are now not
added to the project.assets.json file. This was causing
the NuGet package restore to fail in some cases. For example, if a .NET Standard
project has a project reference to a .NET Core App project, but has the
ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false, then running dotnet restore from the
command line would work, but the restore would fail in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 4.3.1 support</li>
<li> NuGet fallback folders support</li>
<li> AssetTargetFallback support</li>
<li> NuGet operations can be cancelled on closing the solution</li>
<li> Fixed transitive types from references not being available</li>
<li> Fixed credential dialog being shown multiple times on opening a solution</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.2</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-october-9-2017---visual-studio-2017-for-mac-720636">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 4.3.1 support</h2>

<p>NuGet 4.3.1.4445 is now included with Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.</p>

<p>NuGet 4.3.1 includes <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5806">a fix for imports in the project.json file being ignored</a> which could cause a NuGet package
to incorrectly be considered incompatible when restoring NuGet packages.</p>

<h2>NuGet package fallback folders support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core SDK 2.0 defines a NuGet package fallback folder <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder</code> that can be used when looking
for NuGet packages whilst restoring. This fallback folder is now supported by
Visual Studio for Mac 7.2 so that on restoring a .NET Core 2.0 project the NuGet
packages from the fallback folder will be found and do not need to be downloaded from nuget.org into the
local machine NuGet package cache <code>~/.nuget/packages</code>. This should speed up NuGet package restore for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 projects the first time it occurs.</p>

<p>As well as the NuGet fallback folders Visual Studio for Mac will now add the following items to the generated project.assets.json
if they are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>configFilePaths</li>
<li>sources</li>
<li>warningProperties</li>
</ul>


<h2>AssetTargetFallback support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses an AssetTargetFallback MSBuild property
defined in an imported SDK MSBuild files. This is used instead
of the PackageTargetFallback property when determining if a NuGet
package is compatible. Currently the AssetTargetFallback property
is set to net461 by the .NET Core 2.0 SDK which allows .NET Core projects to use NuGet
packages that include assemblies that target the full .NET Framework.
The supported fallback frameworks are now added to the generated
project.assets.json file by Visual Studio for Mac when a .NET Core 2.0 project is restored.</p>

<h2>NuGet operations can be cancelled on the closing the solution</h2>

<p>Previously when closing the solution, or closing Visual Studio for Mac, when a NuGet package
operation was still running would result in a dialog being displayed saying that the
solution cannot be closed until the NuGet operation was completed.
NuGet v3 and above now allow the NuGet
operations to be cancelled so now the dialog allows the current
operation to be cancelled. If the
operation is taking a while to cancel a busy spinner image will be displayed in
the dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-2/CancelNuGetOperationOnClosingSolutionDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Cancel NuGet operation dialog on closing solution&rsquo; &lsquo;Cancel NuGet operation dialog on closing solution&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If a restore is being run when the solution
will be closed the restore will be cancelled automatically without showing the dialog.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore now fails if package and asset target fallbacks are defined by a project</h2>

<p>If both AssetTargetFallback and PackageTargetFallback are defined by a project then the
NuGet restore will fail with an error indicating that they cannot
be used together. This mirrors the behaviour of the .NET Core command
line restore.</p>

<h2>Support imported package references in non .NET Core projects</h2>

<p>If a non .NET Core project had no PackageReference items but imported a file that
did have PackageReference items the NuGet packages were not restored
on opening the solution. This was because only the PackageReference
items defined directly in the project were checked to determine if the
project used NuGet packages. Now the evaluated MSBuild items are checked
so any imported PackageReference items are detected and a restore
will be run on opening the solution.</p>

<p>Note that imported PackageReference items are not displayed in the
Packages folder.</p>

<h2>Package Console is no longer opened when a NuGet operation is cancelled</h2>

<p>When a NuGet operation is cancelled from the main status bar the
Package Console is now not opened when the NuGet operation fails due
to the cancellation. If the NuGet operation is not cancelled then the
Package Console window will still be opened as before if the operation fails.
This is also a workaround for Visual Studio for Mac closing the currently displayed
dialog when the Package Console window opens after the NuGet operation
is cancelled when closing the solution.</p>

<h2>Whitespace is now trimmed when creating a new package source</h2>

<p>When creating a new package source copying and pasting NuGet package source url can sometimes copy extra
whitespace which can then result in NuGet package restore errors such as:</p>

<pre><code>Failed to verify the root directory of local source
' https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json'.
</code></pre>

<p>The package source name and url will now have whitespace trimmed to avoid
this copy and paste problem. This also
matches Visual Studio on Windows behaviour.</p>

<h2>Mark implicit PackageReferences as auto referenced</h2>

<p>PackageReference items that have IsImplicitlyDefined set to true
in their metadata now have autoRefererenced set to true in the project.assets.json file.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive assembly references not available until restart</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC
references LibB which references LibA. If the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet
package was installed into LibA the types from this NuGet package
were not available in LibB or LibC until the solution was closed and
re-opened again. Closing and re-opening the solution refreshes the
reference information used by the type system. Now when a NuGet
package is installed into a .NET Core project the projects that
reference this project have their reference information refreshed. Types from
the installed NuGet packages are then available in projects that
reference this updated project either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive project references after editing a project file</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC references
LibB which references LibA. If a NuGet package is added to LibA by
editing its project file in the text editor the types from this NuGet
package were not available to LibB or LibC without restarting Visual Studio
for Mac or until the packages were restored for the solution. Now when the project file
is saved the projects that directly or indirectly reference the project
will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed credential dialog shown multiple times on opening a solution</strong></p>

<p>With check for updates enabled, multiple projects in the solution,
and a package source that was missing or had invalid credentials,
on opening the solution the credential dialog would be displayed multiple
times even if the correct username and password was entered or the
dialog was cancelled. The dialog was being displayed for each
project and the credential information was not being re-used.</p>

<p>Now the NuGet source repositories are re-used when checking
for updates and also when restoring the projects when the solution
is first opened. Any valid credentials entered will be re-used
when checking the remaining projects. If the credential dialog is
cancelled then the dialog is no longer displayed again whilst
checking for updates for the other projects.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed credential dialog displayed when credentials are available</strong></p>

<p>With valid credentials stored in the Mac key chain the credential dialog would
still be displayed when it should not have been. The problem was that the
NuGet credential service puts itself in a retry mode if any of the
credential providers are used when trying to authenticate against a
package source. Once in this retry mode the Visual Studio for Mac credential
provider would always show a dialog asking for the credentials instead
of re-using the existing credentials. To avoid this the credential
service is reset before any user actions, such as opening the Add Packages
dialog, running a restore or an update.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed crash when displaying Chinese characters in the Add Packages dialog</strong></p>

<p>With the NuGet v3 package source <a href="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json">https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json</a>
selected, searching for Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client would result in
the Visual Studio for Mac terminating when an attempt was made to display the results
in the Add Packages dialog.
The crash was in the Pango library when it attempted to determine the size of
the package title displayed in the search results. If the package
title contained Chinese characters then Pango would throw an exception:</p>

<pre><code>Illegal byte sequence encounted in the input.
at (wrapper managed-to-native) Pango.Layout:pango_layout_get_pixel_size (intptr,int&amp;,int&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>Then when Visual Studio for Mac tried to use Pango again to determine the
size of the text this would result in Visual Studio for Mac terminating.</p>

<p>```
Pango-WARNING (recursed) **: shaping failure, expect ugly output.
shape-engine=&lsquo;BasicEngineCoreText&rsquo;, font=&lsquo;.SF NS Text&rsquo;,
text=&lsquo;∫ê'Stacktrace:</p>

<p>  at <unknown> <0xffffffff>
  at (wrapper managed-to-native) Pango.Layout.pango_layout_get_pixel_size (intptr,int&amp;,int&amp;) [0x0000b] in <c7aa2d93df4045df8dc71d5439f99d72>:0
```</p>

<p>If the NuGet v2 package source was used then this crash did not occur
since the package title was not returned in the search results and the package id would be
displayed instead which does not contain Chinese characters.</p>

<p>As a workaround the Add Packages dialog now displays the package id
instead of the package title.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore project references with ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false when restoring</strong></p>

<p>Project references that have ReferenceOutputAssembly are now not
added to the project.assets.json file. This was causing
the NuGet package restore to fail in some cases. For example, if a .NET Standard
project has a project reference to a .NET Core App project, but has the
ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false, then running dotnet restore from the
command line would work, but the restore would fail in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 4.3 support</li>
<li> Support PackageReference in non .NET Core projects</li>
<li> Enable file template when a NuGet package is installed</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.1</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-august-14-2017---visual-studio-for-mac-7101297">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 4.3 Support</h2>

<p>NuGet 4.3.0.2418 is now included with Visual Studio for Mac 7.1.</p>

<p>This version of NuGet adds support for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0
target frameworks.</p>

<h2>Support PackageReference in non .NET Core projects</h2>

<p>Non .NET Core Sdk style projects that use a PackageReference MSBuild item are now supported.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json"&gt;
  &lt;Version&gt;10.0.1&lt;/Version&gt;
&lt;/PackageReference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In Visual Studio for Mac 7.0 the Solution
window would not show any packages for the project, would not allow
the packages to be restored, and would create a packages.config file when installing
a NuGet package even though the project was using PackageReferences.</p>

<p>Now if the project has a PackageReference the Packages folder
shows the installed packages and can be used to update or install
NuGet packages which will also create PackageReference MSBuild items.</p>

<p>If the project has no PackageReferences then by default a
packages.config file will be created when a NuGet package is installed.</p>

<p>Currently it is not possible to opt-in to using PackageReferences by default.
So the project file will need to be edited in the text editor to include at
least one PackageReference before the default behaviour of using a packages.config
file is overridden.</p>

<h2>Enable file template when a NuGet package is installed</h2>

<p>A file template can now specify that it should be enabled if the project
has a specific reference or has a specific NuGet package installed.
Previously it was only possible to enable a file template based on the
references defined in the project file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HasPackageOrReference PackageId="Xamarin.Forms" Assembly="Xamarin.Forms" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst a reference will work for projects that use a packages.config
file, if the project uses a project.json file or PackageReferences
then checking the references defined in the project would not find any matches and
the file template would not be enabled.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Do not require description when creating a new NuGet package project</strong></p>

<p>When creating a NuGet package project or a multiplatform project the description
needed to be specified in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p>To simplify the project creation
process the package id is used as the description by default. As you type the
package id into the New Project dialog the description text
box will be updated. The description can be changed to be different
to the package id if required.</p>

<p><strong>Fix being unable to load NuGet Package Project created by Visual Studio on Windows</strong></p>

<p>Visual Studio on Windows creates a NuGet package project (.nuproj)
with no target framework version which resulted in 4.0 being used by
default in Visual Studio for Mac. This would cause the project to fail to
load in Visual Studio for Mac since it was checking for 4.5 or later.</p>

<p><strong>Fix no packages shown in Packages folder for NuGet Package Projects</strong></p>

<p>Opening a previously created NuGet package project (.nuproj) would show no
packages in the Packages folder.</p>

<p>The problem was that the PackageReference project item was defined by
both the NuGet addin and the Packaging addin. The NuGet addin&rsquo;s PackageReference
project item was used instead of the one defined by the Packaging addin so no
package references were found for the NuGet package project.</p>

<p><strong>Fix NuGet Package Project&rsquo;s MSBuild targets not being created</strong></p>

<p>If the NuGet package project&rsquo;s generated .nuget.targets or .nuget.props are missing
then these are now created on opening the solution if
automatic restore is enabled.</p>

<p><strong>Fix being unable to package .NET Standard projects</strong></p>

<p>A NuGet package project that referenced an Sdk style .NET Standard project
would fail to build the NuGet package. The build would fail with an error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Project targets '.NETStandard,Version=v1.4'. It cannot be
referenced by a project that targets 'NuGet,Version=v1.0'
</code></pre>

<p>Updating to a more recent NuGet.Build.Packaging NuGet
package, such as version 0.1.276, fixes this problem.</p>

<p><strong>NuGet Package project treated as .NET Core project</strong></p>

<p>NuGet package projects (.nuproj) that use the NuGet.Build.Packaging
0.1.276 NuGet package define a TargetFramework property in an
imported MSBuild .props file. This was causing the project to
be treated as a .NET Core project by Visual Studio for Mac. This caused
the Dependencies folder to be displayed and the References folder
to be removed. Visual Studio for Mac now checks the project has the
Sdk attribute instead of looking at the MSBuild properties defined
by the project when determining the project type.</p>
