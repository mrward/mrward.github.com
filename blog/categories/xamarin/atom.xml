    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A preview of support for the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol">Language Server Protocol</a>
is now available for Visual Studio for Mac 7.4 as a separate extension.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/LanguageServerSupportInVisualStudioMac/DockerLanguageServerClient.gif" title="&lsquo;Docker Language Server client being used in Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo; &lsquo;Docker Language Server client being used in Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A Language Server can provide support for programming language features such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code completion</li>
<li>Find references</li>
<li>Go to definition</li>
<li>Quick fixes</li>
<li>Method signature help</li>
<li>Errors and warnings diagnostics</li>
<li>Documentation on hover</li>
<li>Document formatting</li>
<li>Rename refactoring</li>
</ul>


<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol">Language Server Protocol</a> provides a way for a
client application, such as Visual Studio for Mac, to communicate with the Language Server in order to
use the programming language features it supports.</p>

<p><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a> supports the
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2016/06/27/common-language-protocol">Language Server Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>A preview of <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2017/11/21/announcing-language-server-protocol-preview-release/">Language Server Protocol support in Visual Studio 2017 on Windows</a>
has also been announced.</p>

<p>Currently there is no support for debugging. Whilst there is a
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/api-debugging">debugging protocol</a> support
for this is not currently available in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>The Language Server Protocol does not provide any support for compiling the code. This would need
to be provided by the extension that implements the language client.</p>

<p>More detailed information about the Language Server Protocol can be found on the
<a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol site</a>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Creating a Language Client</strong> section below will take a more detailed look at how to implement
a custom Language Server Client extension in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li>MonoDevelop or Visual Studio Mac 7.4 or later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Source Code</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-language-server-addin">Language Server Client extension for Visual Studio for Mac and MonoDevelop</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Language Server Client extension is available to download from <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-language-server-addin/releases/download/0.1-monodevelop-7.4/MonoDevelop.LanguageServer.Client_0.1.mpack">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To install the extension open the Extensions Manager by selecting Extensions&hellip; from the main menu. Click the Install from file button. Select the .mpack file and then click the Open button.</p>

<p>The extension is also available in the Extensions Manager from the
<a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/Project/Index/307">Visual Studio Extension Repository (Beta channel)</a>.</p>

<h2>Creating a Language Client</h2>

<p>The API provided by the Language Server Client extension follows the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/adding-an-lsp-extension">API defined by the
Language Server Protocol extension used by Visual Studio on Windows</a> as
closely as possible.</p>

<p>More detailed documentation on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/language-server-protocol">Language Server Client API</a> provided
by Visual Studio on Windows is available from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/language-server-protocol">Microsoft docs site</a>.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-language-server-addin">Language Server Client Extension</a> for
Visual Studio for Mac should be installed.</p>

<p>Also ensure you have the <a href="https://github.com/mhutch/MonoDevelop.AddinMaker">Addin Maker extension installed</a>.
This can be installed by selecting Extensions&hellip; from the main menu top open the Extensions Manager.
Select the Gallery tab and use the text box at the top right to search for the Addin Maker extension.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/LanguageServerSupportInVisualStudioMac/ExtensionsDialogAddinMaker.png" title="&lsquo;Addin maker selected in Extensions Manager dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Addin maker selected in Extensions Manager dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Click the Install button to install the Addin Maker extension.</p>

<p>The Addin Maker will be used to create the language client extension.</p>

<h3>Creating an IDE Extension project</h3>

<p>The starting point is to create an IDE Extension project. This project template is provided by the
Addin Maker extension and is available
from the New Project dialog, in the Other &ndash; IDE Extensions category.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/LanguageServerSupportInVisualStudioMac/NewProjectDialogIdeExtension.png" title="&lsquo;IDE Extension project selected in New Project dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;IDE Extension project selected in New Project dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After creating the IDE Extensions project, expand the Dependencies folder to show the
Extensions folder. Right click the Extensions folder and select Add Addin Reference.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/LanguageServerSupportInVisualStudioMac/NewProjectDialogIdeExtension.png" title="&lsquo;IDE Extension project selected in New Project dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;IDE Extension project selected in New Project dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Find the MonoDevelop.LanguageServer.Client in the Add Extension Reference dialog. Select it to
toggle its check box and then click the Add button to reference it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/LanguageServerSupportInVisualStudioMac/AddExtensionReferenceDialogLanguageServerClient.png" title="&lsquo;Language Server Client extension in Add Extension Reference dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Language Server Client extension in Add Extension Reference dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>There are three parts to implementing a language client:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enabling <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-mef">Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)</a> support</li>
<li>Defining the supported content
types</li>
<li>Implementing the ILanguageClient interface.</li>
</ul>


<p>First we will take a look at enabling MEF support.</p>

<h3>Enabling Managed Extensibility Framework Support</h3>

<p>Registration of the language client with Visual Studio for Mac is done using the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-mef">Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF)</a>
which is supported by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>In order to use MEF in your language client extension you need to indicate to Visual Studio
for Mac that it should scan your extension for dependencies. This can be done in the
extension&rsquo;s .addin.xml file by adding the filename of your assembly.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Extension path="/MonoDevelop/Ide/Composition"&gt;
    &lt;Assembly file="MockLanguageExtension.dll" /&gt;
&lt;/Extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Content Type Definition</h3>

<p>Your language client needs to indicate what files are supported. This is done by defining
a content type definition.</p>

<p>```
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServer.Client;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Utilities;</p>

<p>namespace MockLanguageExtension
{</p>

<pre><code>#pragma warning disable CS0649 // Field is never assigned to.

public class FooContentDefinition
{
    [Export]
    [Name("foo")]
    [BaseDefinition(CodeRemoteContentDefinition.CodeRemoteContentTypeName)]
    internal static ContentTypeDefinition FooContentTypeDefinition;

    [Export]
    [FileExtension(".foo")]
    [ContentType("foo")]
    internal static FileExtensionToContentTypeDefinition FooFileExtensionDefinition;
}

#pragma warning restore CS0649
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The above content definition indicates that the .foo file extension is supported by the language client.</p>

<p>You can also define a filename, instead of a file extension, as supported by the language client by using
the FileName attribute instead of the FileExtension attribute.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>class DockerContentTypeDefinition
{
    [Export]
    [Name("docker")]
    [BaseDefinition(CodeRemoteContentDefinition.CodeRemoteContentTypeName)]
    internal static ContentTypeDefinition contentTypeDefinition;

    [Export]
    [FileName("Dockerfile")]
    [ContentType("docker")]
    internal static FileExtensionToContentTypeDefinition dockerFileDefinition;
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You will need to add a reference to <strong>System.ComponentModel.Composition</strong> so the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.componentmodel.composition.exportattribute.aspx">Export attribute</a>
can be used.</p>

<h3>Implementing ILanguageClient</h3>

<p>To integrate the Language Server with Visual Studio for Mac the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclient">ILanguageClient interface</a>
needs to be implemented.</p>

<p>```
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel.Composition;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServer.Client;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Threading;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.Utilities;</p>

<p>namespace MockLanguageExtension
{</p>

<pre><code>[ContentType("foo")]
[Export(typeof(ILanguageClient))]
public class FooLanguageClient : ILanguageClient
{
    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; ConfigurationSections =&gt; null;

    public object InitializationOptions =&gt; null;

    public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; FilesToWatch =&gt; null;

    public string Name =&gt; "Foo Language Extension";

    public event AsyncEventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; StartAsync;
    public event AsyncEventHandler&lt;EventArgs&gt; StopAsync;

    public async Task OnLoadedAsync()
    {
        await StartAsync?.InvokeAsync(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }

    public Task&lt;Connection&gt; ActivateAsync(CancellationToken token)
    {
        var info = new ProcessStartInfo();
        var programPath = Path.Combine(Path.GetDirectoryName(GetType().Assembly.Location), "server", @"LanguageServer.UI.exe");
        info.FileName = "mono";
        info.Arguments = programPath;
        info.WorkingDirectory = Path.GetDirectoryName(programPath);
        info.UseShellExecute = false;
        info.RedirectStandardInput = true;
        info.RedirectStandardOutput = true;

        var process = new Process();
        process.StartInfo = info;

        Connection connection = null;

        if (process.Start())
        {
            connection = new Connection(process.StandardOutput.BaseStream, process.StandardInput.BaseStream);
        }

        return Task.FromResult(connection);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The class that implements the ILanguageClient interface needs to indicate it supports
the content types that you have defined, and it also needs to indicate that it implements the
ILanguageClient by using the Export attribute.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>[ContentType("foo")]
[Export(typeof(ILanguageClient))]
</code></pre>

<p>```
The language client should return a unique description for the ILanguageClient.Name
property.</p>

<p>The two methods that should be implemented are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclient.onloadedasync">OnLoadedAsync</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclient.activateasync">ActivateAsync</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>OnLoadedAsync is called when Visual Studio for Mac has loaded your extension. To activate
your Language Server you need to call StartAsync. The simplest approach is to call StartAsync
in the OnLoadedAsync method.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    public async Task OnLoadedAsync()
    {
        await StartAsync?.InvokeAsync(this, EventArgs.Empty);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Calling StartAsync will cause Visual Studio for Mac to call the ILanguageClient&rsquo;s
ActivateAsync method. This is where you can start the Language Server.</p>

<p>The ActivateAsync method should return a Connection object with the streams that
will be used to communicate with the Language Server. Standard input and output streams
are supported as well as sockets.</p>

<p><code>
var connection = new Connection(process.StandardOutput.BaseStream, process.StandardInput.BaseStream);
</code></p>

<p>The first time you try to run and debug your language client extension you will see an error
in the Application Output similar to:</p>

<p><code>
WARNING: The add-in 'MockLanguageExtension,1.0' could not be updated because some of its
dependencies are missing or not compatible:
  missing: MonoDevelop.LanguageServer.Client,0.1
</code></p>

<p>The Addin Maker runs your language client extension using its own extension database. The
MonoDevelop.LanguageServer.Client extension needs to be installed into this separate database
in order to be able to run and debug your language client extension.</p>

<p>To do this run your language client extension project in Visual Studio for Mac and
install the Language Server Client extension using the Extensions Manager in the instance
of Visual Studio for Mac that is started. Then stop debugging and re-run your extension project
again, and your language client should now be used when you open a supported file.</p>

<p>The content type registration and the ILanguageClient implementation is the minimum
that is needed in order to integrate your Language Server with Visual Studio for Mac.
Now let us take a look at other optional things that can be implemented.</p>

<h3>Receiving Custom Messages</h3>

<p>Your Language Server may support messages that are not part of the standard
Language Server Protocol.</p>

<p>In order to support receiving custom messages the class that implements ILanguageClient should also
implement the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclientcustommessage">ILanguageClientCustomMessage</a>
interface. The CustomMessageTarget property should return an object that will receive the messages.</p>

<p>```
public object CustomMessageTarget => new CustomMessageTarget ();
public object MiddleLayer => null;</p>

<p>public Task AttachForCustomMessageAsync(JsonRpc rpc)
{</p>

<pre><code>return Task.CompletedTask;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>An example CustomMessageTarget class is shown below.</p>

<p>```
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;
using StreamJsonRpc;</p>

<p>namespace MockLanguageExtension
{</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomMessageTarget
{
    [JsonRpcMethod("test/customNotification")]
    public void OnCustomNotification(JToken arg)
    {
        // Handle custom message from the Language Server.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h3>Sending Custom Messages</h3>

<p>To send custom messages to the Language Server the class that implements the
ILanguageClient interface should also implement the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclientcustommessage">ILanguageClientCustomMessage</a> interface.</p>

<p>The AttachForCustomMessageAsync method
should save the JsonRpc object passed and then you can use the JsonRpc object to
send custom messages to the Language Server.</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>    JsonRpc rpc;

    public Task AttachForCustomMessageAsync(JsonRpc rpc)
    {
        this.rpc = rpc;
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public async Task SendMessageToServer()
    {
        string text = await rpc.InvokeWithParameterObjectAsync&lt;string&gt;("GetText");
        MessageService.ShowMessage("Text from language server:", text);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<h3>Middle Layer</h3>

<p>The ILanguageClientCustomMessage defines a MiddleLayer property. An object returned
from the MiddleLayer property can be used to intercept messages sent to and received
from the Language Server. The MiddleLayer object can implement the following
interfaces:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclientcompletionprovider">ILanguageClientCompletionProvider</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclientexecutecommandprovider">ILanguageClientExecuteCommandProvider</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualstudio.languageserver.client.ilanguageclientworkspacesymbolprovider">ILanguageClientWorkspaceSymbolProvider</a></li>
</ul>


<p>```
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServer.Client;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.LanguageServer.Protocol;</p>

<p>namespace MockLanguageExtension
{</p>

<pre><code>class MiddleLayerProvider : ILanguageClientCompletionProvider
{
    public Task&lt;object&gt; RequestCompletions(
        TextDocumentPositionParams param,
        Func&lt;TextDocumentPositionParams, Task&lt;object&gt;&gt; sendRequest)
    {
        return sendRequest(param);
    }

    public async Task&lt;CompletionItem&gt; ResolveCompletion(
        CompletionItem item,
        Func&lt;CompletionItem, Task&lt;CompletionItem&gt;&gt; sendRequest)
    {
        return await sendRequest(item);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Note that currently not all the Language Server messages can be intercepted.</p>

<p>The full source code to the sample Language Server Client Extension created
whilst writing this blog post is available on
<a href="https://github.com/mrward/sample-language-server-client-extension">GitHub</a></p>

<p>There are other examples included with the
<a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-language-server-addin">Language Server Client extension source code</a>
on GitHub, however these are not standalone and are compiled with the
Language Server Client extension.</p>

</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.4</a> can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#15.6">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Solution window detects file system changes</h2>

<p>Files created in the project directory, or a subdirectory,
outside Visual Studio for Mac are now added to the project and
appear in the Solution window automatically.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-4/DotNetCoreProjectFileWatcher.gif" title="&lsquo;File added and removed from command line &ndash; Solution window updated&rsquo; &lsquo;File added and removed from command line &ndash; Solution window updated&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Deleting project files and directories will remove the files from
the Solution window. The Solution window will also update after
a file or a directory is renamed outside Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p><strong>Allow unknown target framework projects to be loaded</strong></p>

<p>The target framework of an SDK style project is no longer restricted.
Previously Visual Studio for Mac would fail to load an SDK style
project unless its target framework was .NET Standard, .NET Core App
or .NET Framework.</p>

<p>This allows Tizen projects to be loaded without the error message
&ldquo;Project does not support framework &lsquo;Tizen,Version=v4.0&rsquo;&rdquo; being
displayed. Tizen projects have a Tizen.NET package reference which
imports an MSBuild .props file that defines the Tizen target framework.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/onovotny/MSBuildSdkExtras">MSBuild.Sdk.Extras</a> NuGet
package is now supported so SDK style projects can use target frameworks
that this NuGet package
supports, such as Xamarin.iOS and MonoAndroid.</p>

<p>On building a project with an unknown target framework, that is
not defined by any used NuGet package references, a build error
that indicates the framework is not supported will occur:</p>

<pre><code>The TargetFramework value 'test1.0' was not recognized.
</code></pre>

<p>NuGet restore will also fail for an unknown target framework with
a message indicating the framework is invalid.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fix xUnit test messages not displayed</strong></p>

<p>xUnit tests support an ITestOutputHelper interface which can be
passed to the constructor of the test. This has a WriteLine method
which can be used to output messages whilst running the test. When
this was used the text displayed in Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;s Test Results
window was:</p>

<pre><code>Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestPlatform.ObjectModel.TestResultMessage
</code></pre>

<p>Now the text from the message is shown in the Tests Results window.</p>

<p><strong>Support target framework defined in another MSBuild property</strong></p>

<p>An SDK style project that defined the <TargetFrameworks> element to
be another MSBuild property would fail to restore.</p>

<p>In the example below the property TheFramework is defined in the
Frameworks.props file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk"&gt;
  &lt;Import Project="Frameworks.props" /&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;TargetFrameworks&gt;$(TheFramework)&lt;/TargetFrameworks&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The unevaluated MSBuild property value was used and would result in the
NuGet package restore failing.</p>

<p>Now the evaluated property value is used when restoring dependencies.</p>

<p><strong>ASP.NET Core minified files and map files are no longer formatted</strong></p>

<p>On creating a new ASP.NET Core project the minified files were being
re-formatted and were no longer minified. Now the .min.css, .min.js and
.map files are excluded from being re-formatted when a new ASP.NET Core
project is created.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed failure to add a new file when the default project namespace contains only numbers</strong></p>

<p>If a project has a default namespace of &lsquo;1&rsquo; then adding a new C#
file from a template would throw a null reference
exception. The problem was that the sanitized namespace for the project&rsquo;s
default namespace was null.</p>

<p><strong>Show SDK information before dependencies are restored</strong></p>

<p>When a new .NET Core project is created the Dependencies &ndash; SDK folder
would show no items until the NuGet package restore completed. Now
the SDK dependency is shown whilst the dependencies are being restored.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed remove item not added for .xaml.cs file</strong></p>

<p>When a new content page with xaml file was
added and then removed, but not deleted,
a remove item was not added for the .xaml.cs file.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed incorrect project updates when moving a file</strong></p>

<p>Moving a Resource file from one folder to another would not update
the project file correctly. Either the project file would not be
modified or the file would be removed.</p>

<p>One problem was that on moving a clone is taken of the original item
and the associated MSBuild item was copied but was still referring
back to the original location. Another problem was that an incorrect
match was being made when looking for remove items resulting in the
wrong files being removed from the project.</p>

    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2018/03/10/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Support NuGet RestoreProjectStyle MSBuild Property</li>
<li> .NET Core xUnit tests not displayed if NuGet packages not cached</li>
<li> No tests displayed when project uses a NUnit PackageReference</li>
<li> NuGet MSBuild imports not removed when migrating to project.json</li>

can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#15.6">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreProjectStyle MSBuild property</h2>

<p>If a project sets the RestoreProjectStyle property to be
PackageReference then the project will be restored as though it has
PackageReferences even if it does not have any.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RestoreProjectStyle&gt;PackageReference&lt;/RestoreProjectStyle&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This fixes runtime problems when a project references a .NET Standard
project that has PackageReferences. Without the RestoreProjectStyle set
the assemblies from the NuGet packages are not copied to the output
directory and would have to be added to the main project.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>.NET Core xUnit tests not displayed if NuGet packages are not in local NuGet cache</strong></p>

<p>If the NuGet packages that contain the VS Test adapters were not available in
the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet package cache then
the Unit Tests window would not show any tests after the NuGet
packages were restored and the project was compiled.</p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac would not initially find any test adapter dlls
and would not attempt to discover any tests for the project after the
NuGet packages were downloaded into the NuGet package cache.</p>

<p>Now after the NuGet package restore has completed the check for a
VS Test adapter is now re-run.</p>

<p><strong>No tests displayed when a project uses a NUnit PackageReference</strong></p>

<p>The Unit Tests window would not show any unit tests when a non .NET
Core project contained a NUnit PackageReference. Visual Studio for
Mac was looking for a PackageReference that contained &lsquo;nunit.framework&rsquo;
and was not finding the NUnit NuGet package reference.</p>

<p><strong>NuGet MSBuild imports not removed when migrating to project.json</strong></p>

<p>When a Portable Class Library project was migrated to use a project.json
file the MSBuild imports added by NuGet were not removed. These imports
are added by NuGet into the generated ProjectName.nuget.props and
ProjectName.nuget.targets files on restoring a project.json file.
Leaving the import in the project file would result in the import
being used twice. When a PCL project that used Xamarin.Forms was
migrated to project.json the project would fail to compile with the
error:</p>

<pre><code>Error XF001: Xamarin.Forms targets have been imported multiple times.
Please check your project file and remove the duplicate import(s).
</code></pre>

<p>Now on migrating to project.json the MSBuild imports added by NuGet packages
to the project are removed.</p>

<p><strong>Fix unhandled exception when searching for packages</strong></p>

<p>An unhandled exception was being logged if a package source returned
an error or the package source url was invalid. This was because a
task was not being observed when the package sources were being used.</p>

<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.3</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-december-4-2017---visual-studio-2017-version-73-730797">release notes</a></p>

<h2>VSTest Console Runner</h2>

<p>Previous versions of Visual Studio for Mac would use <strong>dotnet vstest</strong>,
included with the .NET Core SDK,
to run unit tests for .NET Core projects. Now Visual Studio for Mac includes
the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest">VSTest</a> Console runner and uses that instead of using the .NET Core SDK.</p>

<p>The standalone VSTest Console runner allows other project types, not just .NET Core projects, to
be supported. Visual Studio for Mac can now run <a href="https://xunit.github.io">xUnit</a> tests
for .NET Framework projects. Previously only NUnit was supported.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at using xUnit in a .NET Framework project.</p>

<p>First create a .NET Framework Library project by opening the New Project dialog and selecting
Library from the Other &ndash; .NET &ndash; General category.</p>

<p>Install the following NuGet packages into the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>xunit</li>
<li>xunit.runner.visualstudio</li>
</ul>


<p>Edit MyClass.cs and add some xUnit tests, as shown below:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>using Xunit;</p>

<p>namespace xUnitTests
{</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    [Fact]
    public void PassingTest()
    {
        Assert.True(true);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void FailingTest()
    {
        Assert.False(true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Building the project should then show the xUnit tests in the Unit Tests window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/xUnitTestsInUnitTestsWindow.png" title="&lsquo;xUnit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo; &lsquo;xUnit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that, due to a bug in Visual Studio for Mac, the tests may not appear in the
Unit Tests window if the
xunit.runner.visualstudio was not available in the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet
package cache when it was added to the project. Closing and re-opening the
solution should allow the tests to be discovered.</p>

<p>The tests can then be run or debugged in the usual way.</p>

<p>Currently MSTest is not yet supported in .NET Framework projects. The tests are discovered
but they fail to run with an access denied error message:</p>

<pre><code>An exception occurred while invoking executor 'executor://mstestadapter/v2': 
Access to the path "/TestResults" is denied.
</code></pre>

<h2>Renamed ASP.NET Core Project Templates</h2>

<p>The ASP.NET Core template names displayed in the New Project dialog
have been changed to be more consistent with Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)&rsquo; renamed to &lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App&rsquo; renamed to &lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App (MVC)&rsquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Visual Studio uses (Model-View-Controller) but the shorter
MVC is used by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<h2>New ASP.NET Core F# Project Templates Added</h2>

<p>The following ASP.NET Core F# project templates are now available from the
New Project dialog.</p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET Core Empty

<ul>
<li>.NET Core 1.x and 2.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ASP.NET Core Web API

<ul>
<li>.NET Core 2.0 only</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Support Backslash in Project Template Primary Output Path</h2>

<p>The template.json file used by the new templating engine uses a
primaryOutputs property for projects and files. If the paths used
contained backslashes then the project was not added to the
solution.</p>

<p><code>
"primaryOutputs": [
  { "path": "Library1\\Library1.csproj" },
  { "path": "Library2\\Library2.csproj" }
]
</code></p>

<p>Now the paths have the backslashes replaced with forward slashes if
the current platform does not support backslash as a path
separator.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild property is
read and appended to the list of fallback folders stored in the
project.assets.json file. The .NET Core 2.0 SDK will set this
MSBuild property to point to the NuGet package fallback folder
that is installed with the SDK. This will be used
to resolve NuGet packages first before downloading them to the
~/.nuget/packages folder.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property can be used
to add additional package sources to the existing list of sources
used to resolve packages.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild property can be used by project that uses
PackageReferences to define a set of package fallback folders that
will override any specified in the NuGet.Config file. It can also
be used to clear any pre-defined fallback folders by specifying
&lsquo;clear&rsquo; as its value. Note that this value does not affect any
folders defined by RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders which
will be appended even if RestoreFallbackFolders is set to &lsquo;clear&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Support RestorePackagesPath MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestorePackagesPath MSBuild property can be used to override the global packages
folder location when a project uses a PackageReference.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreSources MSBuild property</h2>

<p>The RestoreSources MSBuild property can be used to override
the sources defined by any NuGet.Config file. Any sources defined in the
RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property will still be appended to the
list of sources if RestoreSources is defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed Transitive Project References not supported</strong></p>

<p>With three .NET Core projects, LibC referencing LibB referencing LibA,
the types defined by LibA were not available to LibC unless it was
directly referencing LibA. In Visual Studio for Mac 7.3 the types
defined by LibA are available to LibC without LibC directly
referencing LibA.</p>

<p><strong>Portable Class Library projects can now be referenced by .NET Core projects</strong></p>

<p>Portable Class Library (PCL) projects could not be referenced by .NET Core
projects or .NET Standard projects. The Edit References dialog would show
&ldquo;Incompatible target framework&rdquo; for the PCL project when trying to add the
reference.</p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac now has the same behaviour as Visual Studio on Windows where
a .NET Standard project can reference any PCL project.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild Update item not removed from project</strong></p>

<p>If a file was deleted from a project, or removed without deleting,
and the file was the last file for a particular wildcard include, the
Update item for the file was not being removed from the project.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild Remove item not added when Update item exists</strong></p>

<p>With a project that contained a single .cs file, and that file had
an Update item defined, when the file was removed from the project,
without deleting it, a Remove item was not being added to the project for the file.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Remove item not being added when file excluded from project</strong></p>

<p>When the last file was removed from the project, but not deleted, an
MSBuild Remove item was not added to the project for the file.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a .NET Standard 2.0 project.</li>
<li>Right click Class1.cs and select Remove.</li>
<li>Select Remove from Project in the dialog that opens.</li>
<li>Close and re-open solution.</li>
</ol>


<p>The Class1.cs file was still shown in the Solution window when it should have been
removed. The project file did not have a Compile remove item for Class1.cs when it should
have been added:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Remove="Class1.cs" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Deleting a XAML file left an MSBuild Remove item in project file</strong></p>

<p>When a .xaml file in a project was deleted the associated
Remove MSBuild item, if it was present, was not being removed from the
project file.</p>

<ol>
<li> Create a new .NET Standard 2.0 project.</li>
<li> Add Xamarin.Forms 2.3 NuGet package.</li>
<li> Add a new Content Page with Xaml file using the New File dialog.</li>
<li> In the Solution window select the .xaml file and delete it.</li>
</ol>


<p>All MSBuild items associated with the .xaml file should have been
removed from the project file but instead a None item would remain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="MyPage.xaml" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Fix MSBuild remove item not added when adding a XAML file</strong></p>

<p>Adding a new .xaml file to a project was not adding a None Remove
item for the .xaml file to remove it from the default wildcard include for all
files.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="MyNewPage.xaml" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On reloading the solution the Solution window would show two .xaml
files &ndash; one EmbeddedResource item and one None item.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild condition evaluation when using Czech locale</strong></p>

<p>With the primary operating system language set to Czech, creating a new .NET
Core project would result in the project having a target framework of net461.</p>

<p>The problem was that Single.TryParse was returing true for an empty string
when the machine&rsquo;s culture was &lsquo;cs-CZ&rsquo;. This was causing the MSBuild condition
evaluation to be treated as a boolean comparison incorrectly in some cases.
The condition below would return false even though the property was
not defined and both sides of the condition were empty strings:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)' == ''"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This was causing the TargetFrameworkIdentifier to not be set for
.NET Core projects so the default of .NETFramework was being used.</p>

<p><strong>Re-evaluate AppliesTo condition on capability change</strong></p>

<p>Fixed the AppliesTo attribute not attaching a project extension to
a project after a NuGet package restore enabled a project capability.
The AppliesTo attribute allows a project extension to be associated
to a project based on its capabilities.</p>

<p>If the project extension uses an AppliesTo attribute which is
initially false and then a new project capability is added, and the
project is re-evaluated, the AppliesTo attribute is now
re-evaluated. This will then cause the project extension to be
attached to the project. If the project extension was attached to the
project and the project capability is removed then the project
extension will now be removed when the project is re-evaluated.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed being unable to run a new Azure Functions project</strong></p>

<p>Creating a new Azure Functions project would result in
being unable to run the project until the solution was closed
and re-opened again. After the NuGet packages are restored the
project can be run but this information was not updated in Visual Studio
for Mac.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package restore, when re-evaluating the project,
the solution startup item is updated if there is no startup item
already defined.</p>

<p>When the project capability is removed, due to a NuGet package
being uninstalled, and the
project can no longer be run the startup item will be updated if
it was previously set to be this project.</p>

<p><strong>Fix generated NuGet files being imported twice</strong></p>

<p>The ProjectName.nuget.g.targets and ProjectName.nuget.g.props,
that are generated for .NET Core projects in the base intermediate
directory, were being imported twice.
Once by Microsoft.Common.props, that is provided with Mono, and once
again by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>Importing these files twice was causing a duplicate file to be added to
the project information held in memory by Visual Studio for Mac
when Xamarin.Forms 2.4 was used and no .NET Core SDK was installed.
This would result in the content page xaml and associated C# file not
being nested in the solution window.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed items added to project when a new content page with XAML was created</strong></p>

<p>Adding a new Xamarin.Forms content page with XAML would add an
update item for the .xaml.cs file, a remove item for the xaml file,
and an include item for the xaml file.</p>

<p>An example is Xamarin.Forms 2.4 which defines wildcard includes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="**\*.xaml" /&gt;
&lt;EmbeddedResource Include="**\*.xaml" SubType="Designer" Generator="MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXaml" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which would cause a new .xaml file added to the project and saved
in the project file as well as a remove for the None item even though
the .xaml file was already removed from the None items.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="MyView.xaml" /&gt;

&lt;EmbeddedResource Include="MyView.xaml"&gt;
  &lt;Generator&gt;MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXaml"&lt;/Generator&gt;
&lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Fix DependentUpon property being saved in project</strong></p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines an update item similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When a project was saved a Compile item was added to the main project
with the filename stored in the DependentUpon element. Now
the evaluated DependentUpon value is treated as being the default
value so it is not added to the project file.</p>

<p><strong>Fix xaml.cs files not being nested</strong></p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines an update item similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The DependentUpon property was being evaluated as &lsquo;*.xaml.cs&rsquo;.
This was causing .xaml.cs files to not be nested in the Solution window.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed build error when Xamarin.Forms 2.4 used in a .NET Standard project</strong></p>

<p>If a Xamarin.Forms .NET Standard project had a
.xaml file and a .xaml.cs file then the xaml.g.cs file would not be
generated when the project file contained no files. The
default items defined by the Xamarin.Forms NuGet package were not
being imported. This then caused a build error about the
InitializeComponent method not being defined.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 uses default
item imports which were not being included since they are conditionally
imported and the MSBuildSDKsPath was not defined:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Forms.DefaultItems.props" Condition="'$(MSBuildSDKsPath)'!=''" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>MSBuild on the command line defines the MSBuildSDKsPath globally in
its MSBuild.dll.config file. The MSBuild engine host, used when
building a project in Visual Studio for Mac, now also defines the
MSBuildSDKsPath property.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed remove item added when removing a linked file</strong></p>

<p>Deleting a file link in a .NET Core project would add a remove item
for the file instead of removing the link from the project.</p>

<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.3</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-december-4-2017---visual-studio-2017-version-73-730797">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Quick Fix &ndash; Install System.ValueTuple NuGet Package</h2>

<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/08/24/whats-new-in-csharp-7-0/">C# 7.0 introduced tuple types</a>
that may require the System.ValueTuple NuGet package
to be added to the project. Visual Studio for Mac
now offers to install the System.ValueTuple NuGet package if the project requires this NuGet package.</p>

<p>Creating a .NET Framework 4.6 project with the following code:</p>

<p>```</p>

<pre><code>public (string, int) GetValues(string id)
{
    return ("Name", 25);
}
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>You will see error markers in the text editor. If you hover over
one of these error markers you will see a
<strong>Predefined type &lsquo;System.ValueTuple`2&rsquo; is not defined or imported</strong> message.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/ValueTupleTextEditorErrorTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;ValueTuple type not defined text editor error tooltip&rsquo; &lsquo;ValueTuple type not defined text editor error tooltip&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you right click the error marker there is now a new
<strong>Install Package &lsquo;System.ValueTuple&rsquo;</strong> Quick Fix action available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/TextEditorInstallSystemValueTuplePackageQuickFix.png" title="&lsquo;Text editor Install System.ValueTuple Package quick fix menu item&rsquo; &lsquo;Text editor Install System.ValueTuple Package quick fix menu item&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>From this menu you can install the latest System.ValueTuple NuGet package
or open the Add Packages dialog to search for a specific version of the System.ValueTuple NuGet
package.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/TextEditorInstallLatestSystemValueTupleQuickFix.png" title="&lsquo;Text editor install latest System.ValueTuple package quick fix menu item&rsquo; &lsquo;Text editor install latest System.ValueTuple package quick fix menu item&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that if the project is targeting .NET Framework 4.7 or .NET Standard 2.0 then the
System.ValueTuple NuGet package is not required.</p>

<p>Also note that the official nuget.org package source needs to be available
for this feature to work.</p>

<h2>NuGetizer 3000 &ndash; Updated NuGet.Build.Packaging to version 0.2</h2>

<p>The version of the NuGet.Build.Packaging NuGet package used by default for NuGetizer 3000 support
has been updated from 0.1.276 to 0.2.0. This fixes a
potential build error when building with Mono 5.6.</p>

<p><code>

<p>The ReadLegacyDependencies target from NuGet.Build.Packaging.Tasks is called when PackOnBuild
is set to true.</p>

<p>The NuGet.Build.Packaging.Tasks assembly was loading an embedded NuGet.ProjectModel
assembly that conflicts with the version that is used by Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild property is
read and appended to the list of fallback folders stored in the
project.assets.json file. The .NET Core 2.0 SDK will set this
MSBuild property to point to the NuGet package fallback folder
that is installed with the SDK. This will be used
to resolve NuGet packages first before downloading them to the
~/.nuget/packages folder.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property can be used
to add additional package sources to the existing list of sources
used to resolve packages.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild property can be used by project that uses
PackageReferences to define a set of package fallback folders that
will override any specified in the NuGet.Config file. It can also
be used to clear any pre-defined fallback folders by specifying
&lsquo;clear&rsquo; as its value. Note that this value does not affect any
folders defined by RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders which
will be appended even if RestoreFallbackFolders is set to &lsquo;clear&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Support RestorePackagesPath MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestorePackagesPath MSBuild property can be used to override the global packages
folder location when a project uses a PackageReference.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreSources MSBuild property</h2>

<p>The RestoreSources MSBuild property can be used to override
the sources defined by any NuGet.Config file. Any sources defined in the
RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property will still be appended to the
list of sources if RestoreSources is defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Transitive dependencies not available when using project.json</strong></p>

<p>With two projects A and B that both use project.json files, project B
referencing project A, the NuGet package dependencies used by project
A were not available to project B transitively. This was because the
project reference information was not being used
when a restore occurred. This caused the assemblies from the transitively
referenced NuGet packages to not be added to the
project.lock.json file for Project B.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to debug a new Azure Functions project without re-opening project</strong></p>

<p>After creating a new Azure Functions project it was possible to build the
project but not to debug it or run it. On closing and re-opening the solution
it would be possible to debug and run the Azure Functions project.</p>

<p>When Visual Studio for Mac created a new Azure Functions project
it initially determined that it could not run or debug the project.
After the Azure Functions project has its PackageReferences restored
it gains an AzureFunctions project capability. This capability is used to
determine if the project can be run. This change in the capability
was not handled by Visual Studio for Mac so it did not allow the
project to be run until the project was closed and re-opened.</p>

<p>Now, after the NuGet package restore is finished, the project is
re-evaluated and a check is made to see if the project can now be run.</p>

<p><strong>Fix generated NuGet files being imported twice</strong></p>

<p>The generated ProjectName.nuget.g.targets and ProjectName.nuget.g.props
that are created for .NET Core projects in the base intermediate
directory were being imported twice when evaluating the project.
Once by Microsoft.Common.props, provided with Mono, and once
by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>This duplicate import was resulting in a duplicate file being added
to the project held in memory by Visual Studio for Mac when the
Xamarin.Forms 2.4 NuGet package was used in a .NET Standard
project and no .NET Core SDK is installed. This would result in the
content page xaml and associated C# file not being nested in the
solution window.</p>
