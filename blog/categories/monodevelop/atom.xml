    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2016/09/17/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xamarin Studio 6.1 was released last week as part of the latest stable <a href="https://blog.xamarin.com/major-updates-ios-10-android-nougat-and-other-tasty-bits/">Xamarin Platform release</a> and it includes changes made to the NuGet support.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 3.4.3 support</li>
<li> Support for project.json files</li>
<li> A specific NuGet package version can now be installed from a list shown in the Add Packages dialog</li>
<li> NuGet operations can now be cancelled from the status bar or Package Console</li>
<li> Support browsing for a local directory when creating a package source</li>
<li> Support forcefully removing a NuGet package when it is missing from all package sources</li>
<li> Packages installed in the solution are no longer shown in the Add Packages dialog</li>
<li> Only global package sources are now shown in Preferences</li>
<li> NuGet version supported is now displayed in the About dialog</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 6.1 can be found in the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_6.1/xamarin.studio_6.1/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 3.4.3 support</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio now includes <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/release-notes/nuget-3.4.3">NuGet 3.4.3</a> which means project.json files are now supported and NuGet packages that only support NuGet 3 or above can now be installed.</p>

<h2>Support for project.json files</h2>

<p>The project.json file is a new package file format introduced with NuGet 3 which supports transitive restore. More detailed information on project.json can be found in the <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/projectjson-intro">NuGet documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A project.json file replaces the packages.config file and holds the NuGet packages
being used by the project. One difference you will notice is that the project.json file may not show the same list of NuGet packages that a packages.config file would show. This is because the project.json file only shows the NuGet packages you explicitly install into your project. So if you install say bootstrap you will only see bootstrap in the project.json file even though it depends on jQuery. If you do the same for a packages.config file you would see both bootstrap and jQuery saved in the file. Another difference is that references are not added to your project file (.csproj) when using a
project.json file.</p>

<p>In order to use a project.json file with Xamarin Studio you will need to create the file yourself in the project directory and close and re-open the solution. The project.json file needs to be
available when you open the project otherwise Xamarin Studio will default to using a packages.config file.</p>

<p>An example project.json file for a .NET 4.5 library project is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "frameworks": {
    "net45": {}
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you add a NuGet package to a project that uses a project.json file the NuGet package
information will be added into a dependencies section:</p>

<pre><code> "dependencies": {
   "NUnit": "3.2.1"
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that when using a project.json file the project will not display a From Packages directory
inside the References folder. This is because the project file does not have any
references added to it when using a project.json and the reference information is currently not available from the project system.</p>

<p>Please note that there are <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/23/changes-to-project-json/">future plans</a> to move the information stored in a project.json file into the project file.</p>

<h1>NuGet 3 package source</h1>

<p>Xamarin Studio now supports using the NuGet 3 package source:</p>

<p><a href="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json">https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json</a></p>

<p>This can be added into your package sources in Preferences. It is also the package
source that will be created by default if your global <a href="http://lastexitcode.com/projects/NuGet/FileLocations/">NuGet.Config file</a> is missing.</p>

<h2>Installing a specific NuGet package version from the Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>Older versions of Xamarin Studio supported being able to install specific package versions by using a package version search in the Add Packages dialog as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>NUnit version:*
</code></pre>

<p>This package version search was not easy to discover and so it has been removed and replaced in Xamarin Studio 6.1 with a combo box that allows a particular version to be selected. The Version combo box is in the bottom right hand corner of the Add Packages dialog as shown in the screenshots below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackagesDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Add Packages dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Add Packages dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackagesDialogWithVersionComboBoxSelected.png" title="&lsquo;Add Packages dialog with version combo box selected&rsquo; &lsquo;Add Packages dialog with version combo box selected&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that in order to populate the version combo box a second request is sent to the
package source so it may not show all the versions immediately.</p>

<p>Also note that for package sources which are local directories only the latest version will be displayed in the version combo box.</p>

<h2>Cancelling a NuGet operation</h2>

<p>With Xamarin Studio you can now cancel the currently running NuGet package operation. This can be done
by clicking the red Stop button in the Status Bar or in the Package Console.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/StatusBarStopButton.png" title="&lsquo;Status bar stop button&rsquo; &lsquo;Status bar stop button&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Adding local package sources</h2>

<p>When adding a package source in Preferences it is now easier to create a package source for
a directory on your local machine. There is now a browse button which will allow you to browse to a directory and add it rather than having to type the full path into the text box.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackageSourceDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Add Package Source dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Add Package Source dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The Add Package Source dialog has also been changed to make it more obvious that either a URL or a folder can be used as a package source. The URL label has been changed to Location and the placeholder text now specifies that a URL or a folder can be used.</p>

<h2>Forced NuGet package removal</h2>

<p>A NuGet package can now be removed when it not restored and is unavailable from all package sources.</p>

<p>With older versions of Xamarin Studio a NuGet package must be restored before it can be
removed. This is a requirement of NuGet since it requires the original NuGet package to work out what has been installed so it can determine what needs to be uninstalled. NuGet can do more than just update the project file with references and MSBuild .targets files, it may add new files to the project or it may run app.config or web.config transforms.</p>

<p>When the NuGet package removal fails because the NuGet package cannot be restored a dialog will be
displayed asking whether you want to try to remove the NuGet package anyway. If the OK button is selected
then Xamarin Studio will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the NuGet package from the packages.config file.</li>
<li>Remove any assembly references for the NuGet package from the project file (.csproj).</li>
<li>Remove any Imports that refer to .targets or .props files that were included with that NuGet package.</li>
</ol>


<p>This process may miss files that were added to the project by NuGet but in the majority of cases it should remove the NuGet package successfully without having to manually remove the NuGet package information from the project file.</p>

<h2>Packages installed in solution are no longer shown in Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>With previous versions of Xamarin Studio all packages installed in the solution were shown first in the list of packages in the Add Packages dialog. Packages installed in the solution are now no longer shown in the Add Packages dialog.</p>

<h2>Only global package sources shown in Preferences</h2>

<p>The package sources shown in the Preferences dialog are now only read from the global NuGet config file. Per-solution NuGet.Config files located in individual solution directories are no longer read when showing the package sources in Preferences. This is because changes made in Preferences only modifies the global NuGet.Config file.</p>

<p>The package sources shown in the Add packages dialog will still include package sources defined in a solution&rsquo;s NuGet.Config file and is unaffected by this change.</p>

<h2>NuGet version displayed in About dialog</h2>

<p>The version of NuGet supported by Xamarin Studio is now displayed in the About dialog when the Show Details button is selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AboutDialog.png" title="&lsquo;About dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;About dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild  .targets files were not always added to the end of the project</strong></p>

<p>When installing a NuGet package that has a .targets file the Import element created was grouped with the existing Import elements. This is OK most of the time however if there are other items in the project added after the import then any build targets may fail since these items are included after the import. One example is the netfx-System.StringResources NuGet package which may not find any resource files that occur in the project after its Import element.</p>

<p>Now .targets files are added as the last element in the project file. This also makes the behaviour consistent with how NuGet works in Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild .props files were not added to the start of the project</strong></p>

<p>Installing a NuGet package that included an MSBuild .props file would add an Import element for the .props file at the end of the project file which is incorrect. Now .props files are added to the project file as the first child element inside the Project&rsquo;s root element.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p><strong>Offline package restore</strong></p>

<p>Package restore may not work when you are offline
even though the NuGet packages may be available in the local NuGet cache on your machine.</p>

<p>The current workaround is to create a package source that
points to a local directory containing all the required NuGet packages and disable all online
NuGet package sources. With just the local package source enabled you can then restore the NuGet packages when you are
offline. Note that this problem also affects Visual Studio 2015.</p>

    <updated>2016-08-20T12:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2016/08/20/NuGetExplorerForXamarinStudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When diagnosing why a NuGet package cannot be installed into a project the application I use is the excellent <a href="https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer">NuGet Package Explorer</a>. Whenever there is an error trying to install a NuGet package, similar to the one shown below, you can open the NuGet package with NuGet Package Explorer and take a look at the target frameworks it supports.</p>

<pre><code>You are trying to install this package into a project that targets 'MonoAndroid,Version=v6.0',
but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework.
</code></pre>

<p>Currently <a href="https://github.com/NuGetPackageExplorer/NuGetPackageExplorer">NuGet Package Explorer</a> is only available on Windows. On other operating systems you can change the file extension to .zip, extract the contents of the NuGet package, or open it into a zip application, and take a look at the files.</p>

<p>To make exploring NuGet packages easier on operating systems where the NuGet Package Explorer application is not available there is a now <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-nuget-package-explorer">NuGet Explorer addin</a> that you can install into Xamarin Studio or MonoDevelop. With this addin you can open and explore NuGet packages from online package sources or from the local file system.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/ViewingAndroidSupportNuGetPackageContents.png" title="&lsquo;Exploring the Xamarin.Android.Support NuGet package in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;Exploring the Xamarin.Android.Support NuGet package in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Now let us take a look in more detail of the features provided by the NuGet Package Explorer addin.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open and view NuGet packages from online package sources or from the local file system.</li>
<li>View the NuGet package metadata.</li>
<li>View the NuGet package files.</li>
<li>View the NuGet package .nuspec file.</li>
<li>Open any file stored inside the NuGet package.</li>
<li>Open other NuGet packages that are listed as dependencies.</li>
</ul>


<p>Supports Xamarin Studio 6.0 and MonoDevelop 6.0.</p>

<h2>Opening a NuGet Package from a Package Source</h2>

<p>To open a NuGet package from a package source you can select Open NuGet Package from the File menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/FileOpenNuGetPackageMenu.png" title="&lsquo;File Open NuGet Package menu&rsquo; &lsquo;File Open NuGet Package menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Alternatively if you have a project open you can right click the Packages folder in the Solution window and select Open NuGet Package.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/OpenNuGetPackagePackagesFolderMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Open Package menu on Packages folder&rsquo; &lsquo;Open Package menu on Packages folder&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This will open the Open Package dialog. This dialog is the same as the Add Packages dialog used when installing a NuGet package and allows you to search for NuGet packages. The dialog is based on the version available with Xamarin Studio 6.1 so it has a version combo box where you can select a specific package version instead of having to remember the syntax for the package version search.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/OpenPackageDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Open NuGet Package dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Open Package dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Select one or more NuGet packages and click the Open Package button to download and display them in Xamarin Studio.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/ViewingJsonNetPackageContents.png" title="&lsquo;Exploring the JSON.NET NuGet package in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;Exploring the JSON.NET NuGet package in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The NuGet package metadata is shown on the left. On the right are the files that the NuGet package contains. You can also view the .nuspec file stored in the NuGet package by selecting the NuSpec tab at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/ViewingJsonNetNuSpec.png" title="&lsquo;Viewing JSON.NET .nuspec file&rsquo; &lsquo;Viewing JSON.NET .nuspec file&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Exploring Dependencies</h2>

<p>NuGet package dependencies are displayed with hyperlinks.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/ViewingJsonNetPackageDependencies.png" title="&lsquo;Viewing JSON.NET dependencies&rsquo; &lsquo;Viewing JSON.NET dependencies" ></p>

<p>If you click one these hyperlinks the Open Package dialog will be opened and the package will be searched for. You can then choose a package version and open the NuGet package.</p>

<h2>Opening Files Contained Inside the NuGet Package</h2>

<p>To open a file contained inside a NuGet package you can double click the file, or right click the file and select Open.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/OpenFileInsideNuGetPackageMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Open menu to open file inside NuGet package into Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;Open menu to open file inside NuGet package into Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The file will then be opened inside Xamarin Studio.</p>

<h2>Opening a NuGet Package File</h2>

<p>If you have a NuGet Package (.nupkg) stored on the local machine that is not available from any package source you can open the file directly in Xamarin Studio by selecting Open from the File menu.</p>

<p>You can also associate .nupkg files directly with Xamarin Studio and have them automatically open inside the IDE.</p>

<h2>Opening a NuGet Package Installed in a Project</h2>

<p>You can explore NuGet packages that are installed in your project by right clicking the package in the Solution window and selecting Open Package.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetPackageExplorerForXamarinStudio/OpenInstalledPackageMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Open installed package context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Open installed package context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Installing the NuGet Package Explorer addin</h2>

<p>The NuGet Package Explorer addin is available from the MonoDevelop addin repository on the beta channel. It can be installed by from the Add-in Manager by searching the gallery and then clicking the Install button.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-24T21:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2016/07/24/FileNestingInXamarinStudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With recent versions of Xamarin Studio it is not currently possible to nest files without directly editing the project file. In the past it was possible to drag and drop a file so it was then nested inside another file.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/SolutionWindowWithNestedFiles.png" title="&lsquo;Solution window with nested files in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution window with nested files in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Visual Studio also does not support nesting files by using drag and drop however
<a href="http://madskristensen.net/">Mads Kristensen</a> created a <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3ebde8fb-26d8-4374-a0eb-1e4e2665070c">File Nesting extension</a> that adds support for manual and automatic nesting of files within Visual Studio. There is a <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/MadsKristensen/Introducing-File-Nestor-for-Visual-Studio">demo video of the File Nesting extension</a> that shows the extension being used with Visual Studio.
 This extension has now been ported to Xamarin Studio and is available from the <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop Add-in Repository</a>.</p>

<p>Let us take a walkthrough of the features of the File Nesting addin for Xamarin Studio.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Manual file nesting</li>
<li>Manual file un-nesting</li>
<li>Automatic file nesting of selected files based on rules</li>
<li>Automatic file nesting when files are added to a project</li>
<li>Options to specify which file nesting rules are applied</li>
</ul>


<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li>Xamarin Studio 6.0 or MonoDevelop 6.0.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Manual File Nesting</h2>

<p>To manually nest a file select it in the Solution window then right click and select File Nesting &ndash; Nest Item&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/NestItemContextMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Manual file nesting &ndash; nest item context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Manual file nesting &ndash; nest item context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This will open a file nesting dialog where the parent file can be selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/FileNestingDialog.png" title="&lsquo;File nesting dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;File nesting dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Select the parent file and click OK to nest the file under that parent file.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/ManualFileNestingResultInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Manual file nesting result in solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Manual file nesting result in solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>You can also nest multiple files under a parent by selecting multiple files in the Solution window and selecting the Nest Item menu.</p>

<h2>Manual File Un-nesting</h2>

<p>To un-nest a file select it in the Solution window then right click and select File Nesting &ndash; Un-nest Item.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/UnNestItemContextMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Manual file nesting &ndash; un-nest item context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Manual file nesting &ndash; un-nest item context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The file will then be un-nested from its parent.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/ManualFileUnNestingResultInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Manual file un-nesting result in solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Manual file un-nesting result in solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Automatic Nesting Rules</h2>

<p>The file nesting rules are available from the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/FileNestingRulesInPreferencesDialog.png" title="&lsquo;File nesting rules in preferences&rsquo; &lsquo;File nesting rules in preferences&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Each rule has a tooltip which will show more detailed information about what the rule does.</p>

<h3>Enable auto-nesting</h3>

<p>The Enable auto-nesting option will enable or disable automatic file nesting when a file is added to a project.</p>

<h3>Enable extension rule</h3>

<p>This rule will nest files added with an extra extension under their corresponding parent file. For example MyView.xaml.cs nests under MyView.xaml.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/NestedFileUsingExtensionRule.png" title="&lsquo;Nested file using extension rule&rsquo; &lsquo;Nested file using extension rule&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Enable interface implementation rule</h3>

<p>This nests C# interface implementations under the corresponding interface based on the filename. For example, if there is an interface file IMyInterface.cs then a new file called CustomMyInterface.cs will be nested under the IMyInterface file.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/NestedCSharpInterfaceFilesInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Nested file using interface implementation rule&rsquo; &lsquo;Nested file using interface implementation rule&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Enable known file type rule</h3>

<p>This nests certain known files types. For example, MyPage.ts will be nested under MyPage.html.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/NestedFileUsingKnownFileTypeRule.png" title="&lsquo;Nested file using known file type rule&rsquo; &lsquo;Nested file using known file type rule&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Enable path segment rule</h3>

<p>This nests files with an added path segment under its parent. For example, MyFile.Designer.cs nests under MyFile.cs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/NestedFileUsingPathSegmentRule.png" title="&lsquo;Nested file using path segment rule&rsquo; &lsquo;Nested file using path segment rule&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Automatic Nesting of Selected Files</h2>

<p>To automatically nest files, based on the enabled file nesting rules, select the files, or folder, or project, then right click and select File Nesting &ndash; Auto-nest selected items.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/AutoNestSelectedItemsContextMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Auto-nest selected items context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Auto-nest selected items context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This will then apply the enabled file nesting rules to the selected files.</p>

<h2>Automatic File Nesting on Adding Files</h2>

<p>To enable automatic file nesting when files are added right click the project and select File Nesting &ndash; Enable automatic nesting.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/EnableAutomaticNestingContextMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Enable automatic nesting context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Enable automatic nesting context menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A check box will be displayed next to this menu item if this feature is enabled. Now when a file is added the enabled nesting rules will be applied and the file will be automatically nested.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The File Nesting addin is available from the <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop Add-in Repository</a> on the beta channel. To install the addin open the Add-in Manager, search for the File Nesting addin, then click the Install button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/FileNestingInXamarinStudio/FileNestingAddinSelectedInAddinManagerWindow.png" title="&lsquo;File Nesting addin in addin manager window&rsquo; &lsquo;File Nesting addin in addin manager window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After installing the addin Xamarin Studio will need to be restarted for the addin to work correctly.</p>

    <updated>2016-07-09T12:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2016/07/09/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest version of the .NET Core addin for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop now supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test">.NET Core Test Runners</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/DotNetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Xamarin Studio uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/test-protocol">.NET Core test communication protocol</a> to support .NET Core test runners. This protocol provides a way to discover and run the unit tests provided by a .NET Core test runner.</p>

<p>When Xamarin Studio finds a testRunner in the project.json file it will attempt to discover the unit tests for that project.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "version": "1.1.0-*",

    "testRunner": "nunit",

    "dependencies": {,
        "NUnit": "3.4.0",
        "dotnet-test-nunit": "3.4.0-beta-1"
    },

    "frameworks": {
        "netcoreapp1.0": {
            "imports": [
                "netcoreapp1.0",
                "portable-net45+win8"
            ],
            "dependencies": {
                "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
                    "version": "1.0.0-*",
                    "type": "platform"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The discovered tests are then shown in the Unit Tests window.</p>

<p>Debugging the unit tests is not yet supported.</p>

<p><a href="https://xunit.github.io/">xUnit</a> and <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit</a> provide .NET Core test runners and both of these are supported in Xamarin Studio. More information can be found in existing tutorials on how to use these test runners:</p>

</ul>


<p>More information on all the changes in Xamarin Studio 6.0 can be found in the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_6.0/xamarin.studio_6.0/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Support NuGet packages targeting watchOS</h2>

<p>A new Xamarin.WatchOS target framework is now supported which allows NuGet packages to contain assemblies for watchOS.</p>

<h2>Support updating pre-release NuGet packages</h2>

<p>Previously it was not possible to update a pre-release NuGet package to a later pre-release  from the Solution window, only updates to stable NuGet packages were supported. The only way to update to a later pre-release NuGet package was to use the Add Packages dialog.</p>

<p>Now an individual pre-release NuGet package can be updated by right clicking and selecting Update. When all packages in a project or solution are updated then pre-release NuGet packages will be updated to a later pre-release version if they are available.</p>

<h2>Show updates available for pre-release NuGet packages</h2>

<p>Previously Xamarin Studio would only show stable NuGet package updates as being available if a pre-release NuGet package was installed. Now Xamarin Studio will check for updates for pre-release NuGet packages as well as stable packages and display this information in the Solution window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-0/PreReleaseNuGetPackageUpdatesInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Pre-release NuGet package updates in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Pre-release NuGet package updates in Solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Only if an installed NuGet package is a pre-release version will pre-release updates be shown as available in the Solution window. Xamarin Studio will not check for pre-release updates for stable NuGet package versions that are installed.</p>

<h2>Remember Show pre-release Packages setting in Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>The Show pre-release Packages check box setting will now be remembered in the Add Packages dialog on a per solution basis.</p>

<h2>Error dialog displayed if the NuGet.Config file cannot be read</h2>

<p>Previously if the NuGet.Config file could not be read the error would
be silently logged, but not reported, and Xamarin Studio would
then switch to using the default official NuGet package source. Now an error
dialog is shown indicating that there was a problem reading the
NuGet.Config file.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Support NuGet packages that use icons from local files</strong></p>

<p>A NuGet package can now use an icon, which will be shown in the Add Packages
dialog, taken from the local file system using a file url. Previously this would fail with an invalid cast exception.</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect update count displayed after updating NuGet packages.</strong></p>

<p>When an update caused a NuGet package to be uninstalled the Packages
folder in the Solution window would show an incorrect count for the available updates.</p>

<p><strong>NuGet restore and update not working for workspaces</strong></p>

<p>With a workspace opened, or multiple solutions opened in Xamarin Studio, then restoring and updating NuGet packages would only work for one of the solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to add Google Play Services packages</strong></p>

<p>The Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat NuGet package depends on
a single version of the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 NuGet package.
When a Xamarin Google Play Services NuGet package is installed
that depends on a higher version of the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4
NuGet package the install would fail to find a version of the
AppCompat NuGet package that is compatible. An error similar to the
following would be displayed in the Package Console window:</p>

<pre><code>Could not add Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.Ads.
Updating 'Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 23.1.1.0' to
'Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 23.1.1.1' failed. Unable to find a version
of 'Xamarin.Android.Support.v7.AppCompat' that is compatible with
'Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 23.1.1.1'.
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was that the AppCompat NuGet package is not involved
in the initial NuGet package resolution using the remote package
source so it is initially not considered for installation into the
packages directory. When a package reference is then added to the
packages.config file a search for a compatible AppCompat package was
only using the local solution&rsquo;s packages directory which fails causing
the install to fail.</p>

<p>To fix this the local solution packages directory is used first
when looking for a compatible AppCompat NuGet package and will
fallback to using the configured remote package sources if no suitable package
is found in this directory. To handle a package being added to the
packages.config at this point, after the original NuGet packages have
already been downloaded to the solution&rsquo;s packages directory, Xamarin Studio will detect a package is added to the packages.config file and install the NuGet package if it is not
already in the local solution packages directory.</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect package version being installed</strong></p>

<p>When installing a NuGet package using the Google Play Services dialog a package version is not specified by the dialog. If the NuGet package being installed was found in the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet cache it would be used instead of the latest version from the official NuGet gallery at nuget.org. This could result in a lower version being installed than expected.</p>

<p><strong>MSBuild property files (.props) not being added at correct project location</strong></p>

<p>Installing a NuGet package that included an MSBuild .props file would
add an Import element for the .props at the end of the project file
(.csproj) instead of at the start. The .props files are now added to the project
file as the first child element inside the project&rsquo;s root element.</p>
