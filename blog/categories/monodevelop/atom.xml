</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.8 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.8/xamarin.studio_5.8/">release notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Allow ASP.NET project templates to work offline</strong></p>

<p>Previously it was not possible to create an ASP.NET project without an internet connection even if all the NuGet packages were available in the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet packages cache.</p>

<p>Now the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet cache is used as the primary source of packages for project templates so it is possible to create an ASP.NET project without an internet connection if the NuGet packages are already in this cache.</p>

<p>This problem did not affect project templates, such as Xamarin.Forms, which include the NuGet packages with their project templates.</p>

<p><strong>Build error after updating Xamarin.Forms in a project created by Visual Studio</strong></p>

<p>When a NuGet package that uses custom MSBuild targets file, such as Xamarin.Forms, is added to a project by Visual Studio the project file has an extra Target added, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name="EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports" BeforeTargets="PrepareForBuild"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;ErrorText&gt;This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer.
Enable NuGet Package Restore to download them.  For more information, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=322105. The missing file is {0}.&lt;/ErrorText&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;Error Condition="!Exists('packages\Xamarin.Forms.1.2.1.6229\build\portable-win+net45+wp80+MonoAndroid10+MonoTouch10\Xamarin.Forms.targets')" Text="$([System.String]::Format('$(ErrorText)', 'packages\Xamarin.Forms.1.2.1.6229\build\portable-win+net45+wp80+MonoAndroid10+MonoTouch10\Xamarin.Forms.targets'))" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the project was opened in a previous version of Xamarin Studio, and the NuGet package is updated or removed, the Error task was not updated. The project would then fail to compile with an error being reported that the old .targets file could not be found.</p>

<p>Now when updating or removing a NuGet package the EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target is
checked and the matching Error task will be removed. If there are no remaining Error tasks then the EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target is also removed. This prevents build errors after updating or uninstalling the old
NuGet package from the project.</p>

<p>Note that Xamarin Studio will not add an EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target and will not add Error tasks to a project when a NuGet package is added or updated.</p>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild task not updated after updating Xamarin.Forms</strong></p>

<p>If a project that had a reference to Xamarin.Forms was compiled once, then the NuGet package was updated, the old MSBuild task was still being used when compiling.</p>

<p>For Xamarin.Forms this could cause a &ldquo;XamlG Task failed unexpectedly&rdquo; build error to be reported. Also the Package Console would report not being able to access the Xamarin.Forms.Build.Tasks.dll when updating or removing the NuGet package.</p>

<p>The problem was that MonoDevelop.Projects.Formats.MSBuild.exe that compiles the project would lock the MSBuild task assembly.</p>

<p>Now when an MSBuild import is removed on updating a NuGet package Xamarin Studio will dispose the current project builder which will shutdown the MonoDevelop.Projects.Formats.MSBuild.exe process. This unlocks any custom MSBuild task assemblies loaded by this process,
allowing the old NuGet package to be removed without any access denied errors, and when the project is recompiled again it will use the correct MSBuild task assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Update information in the Solution window incorrect after updating packages</strong></p>

<p>With check for updates enabled in Preferences, when an ASP.NET project is created, updates are shown as available for several packages. When
the packages are updated the Solution window would still show updates as being available even though the packages had been updated.</p>

<p>The problem was that a change was made in Xamarin Studio 5.7 to update package dependencies at the same time as the package was updated. This meant that an update event was not fired for each
package being updated which would result in some package updates being shown as available in the Solution window even when they had been updated.</p>

<p>Now Xamarin Studio will check all package references when a package is updated so if any package dependencies are updated the Solution
window will show the correct status of the packages.</p>

<p><strong>Check for package updates continues after closing a solution</strong></p>

<p>Xamarin Studio will now stop checking for package updates when the current solution is closed. Previously this would continue until the check was completed.</p>

<p><strong>Check for updates prevents packages from being removed</strong></p>

<p>Previously when Xamarin Studio was checking for package updates all other NuGet actions, such as updating, adding or removing packages, would not be run until the check for updates had completed.
Now the check for NuGet package updates is done on a separate thread so other NuGet actions can be run at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect error message displayed when checking for package updates</strong></p>

<p>The Package Console would sometimes show the error message &ldquo;An exception was thrown while dispatching a method call in the UI thread.&rdquo; instead of the underlying error making it difficult to determine the cause of the problem.
For example if there was a zero byte sized .nupkg file in the solution&rsquo;s package directory, and check for updates is enabled, then
the wrong error was displayed in the Package Console.</p>

<p><strong>Exception when checking for package updates after changing target framework of a project</strong></p>

<p>Previously a null reference exception would be reported in the Package console window when doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> Create a project with one NuGet package added.</li>
<li> Create two NuGet package sources in Preferences. Disable all other package sources.</li>
<li> Open the Add Packages dialog and select All Sources.</li>
<li> Go back to Preferences and uncheck both of the package sources.</li>
<li> Change the target framework of the project in the project options.</li>
</ol>

<h2>NuGet menus renamed</h2>

<p>The menus have been changed so they now include the word NuGet to make them easier to discover.</p>

<h3>Project menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/ProjectMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the main Project menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the main Project menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Solution context menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionContextMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Solution context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Solution context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Project context menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/ProjectContextMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Project context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Project context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Solution Window</h2>

<p>The warning icon used in the Solution window has been changed so it is consistent with other Solution window items.</p>

<h3>Package not restored</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageMissing.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageMissingWithTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored with tooltip&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored with tooltip&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A new warning icon is used for packages that are not restored, the text is greyed out and hovering over the warning icon shows information about the warning.</p>

<h3>Package installing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageInstalling.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package installing&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package installing&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>When a package is being installed the text is greyed out to indicate that the package is not currently available in the project and the text shows (installing) to distinguish between a package being installed and a package that is not restored.</p>

<h3>Package needs retargeting</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageNeedsRetargetingWithTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package needs retargeting&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package needs retargeting&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A new warning icon is used for packages that need retargeting. The package id text has changed to black text instead of orange. Hovering over warning icon shows a message that the package needs retargeting.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Build errors after MSBuild target restored for package</strong></p>

<p>If a NuGet package had an MSBuild target that added extra references to the project then on restoring the
NuGet package those references were still unavailable and the build would still fail.</p>

<p>This problem occurs with the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package. The MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package has a custom MSBuild .targets file that adds extra references:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="MonoGame.Framework"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\MonoGame.Framework.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="Tao.Sdl"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\Tao.Sdl.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="OpenTK"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\OpenTK.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package is not available on opening the
project in Xamarin Studio the project will fail to build after
restoring the NuGet package since the references in the MSBuild targets file were not being refreshed.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package restore the MSBuild host used by Xamarin Studio is
refreshed which allows the references in the MSBuild targets file to be found and the project to compile without any build errors.</p>

<p><strong>Types imported by MSBuild target not recognised after NuGet package installed</strong></p>

<p>If a NuGet package had an MSBuild target that added extra references to the project then on installing the
NuGet package the types from those references were still unavailable to Xamarin Studio and would be highlighted in red
in the text editor. To fix this the solution had to be closed and re-opened. This problem occurs with the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package is installed and it contains a MSBuild targets
file then Xamarin Studio&rsquo;s type system will be refreshed for that project. The
types will then be known by Xamarin Studio and no longer be highlighted in red in the text editor.</p>

<p><strong>Solution window cannot be opened when access to NuGet.Config is denied</strong></p>

<p>If the NuGet directory containing the NuGet.Config file cannot be created or read by NuGet then an exception is thrown. This exception was not being handled by Xamarin Studio and would prevent the
solution window from opening.</p>

<p>Now if there is any error creating this
directory, or trying to load the NuGet.Config file, then the exception is caught which allows the Solution window to open. If the NuGet directory containing the NuGet.Config file cannot be created then it will not be possible to use NuGet in Xamarin Studio but it will not prevent the solution pad from being used.</p>

<p><strong>Updating all packages not updating dependencies</strong></p>

<p>Updating NuGet packages for the entire solution would not install the Xamarin.Android.Support.v13 NuGet package which was added as a new dependency to the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 NuGet package.</p>

<p>The problem was that the NuGet package update was not configured to update any
NuGet package dependencies when updating all packages in the solution.
Updating all packages in the project or the NuGet package individually
would update package dependencies correctly.</p>

<p>Note that this fix has introduced a bug where Xamarin Studio will show updates as available even though the updates have just been installed for the solution. This new bug should be fixed in Xamarin Studio 5.8.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-release NuGet package being downgraded on update</strong></p>

<p>When a pre-release NuGet package was installed that was newer than the latest stable NuGet package available then updating the package would install the stable version even though it was a lower version. Now an explicit check is made to ensure that an older NuGet package is not being installed.</p>

    <link href="http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/10/19/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/"/>
    <updated>2014-10-19T14:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/10/19/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> Package version constraints in packages.config files are now supported</li>
<li> <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/">Xamarin Components</a> can now have NuGet package dependencies</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.5 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.5/xamarin.studio_5.5/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet Package Version Constraints</h2>

<p>NuGet allows you to <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/versioning">define a range of package versions that are allowed in your project</a> using the <strong>allowedVersions</strong> attribute in the packages.config file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;packages&gt;
  &lt;package id="Newtonsoft.Json" version="5.0.1" allowedVersions="[5.0,6.0)" targetFramework="MonoAndroid44" /&gt;
&lt;/packages&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the above packages.config file the project has Json.NET 5.0.1 installed and will only allow updates to versions of Json.NET that are below 6.0.</p>

<p>When you open the solution in Xamarin Studio, and check for updates is enabled in preferences, you will see updates in the Solution window that are valid given the constraint defined in the packages.config file. In the screenshot below an update is shown for Json.NET 5.0.8 in the Solution window even though Json.NET currently has version 6.0.5 available.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/JsonNet508PackageUpdateAvailableInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Json.NET 5.0.8 package update available shown in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Json.NET 5.0.8 package update available shown in Solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>When you update the NuGet packages from the Solution window Xamarin Studio will now update to a NuGet package that meets the version constraints defined in the packages.config. In the Package Console screenshot below the Json.NET package was updated, with the constraint in place, and Json.NET 5.0.8 was installed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/JsonNet508PackageInstalledInPackageConsole.png" title="&lsquo;Json.NET package updated to 5.0.8 &ndash; Package Console output&rsquo; &lsquo;Json.NET package updated to 5.0.8 &ndash; Package Console output&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that if you install a NuGet package from the Add Packages dialog you can override the constraint and install a NuGet package with a version outside of the range of the constraint.</p>

<h2>Components with NuGet Packages</h2>

<p>A Component from <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/">Xamarin&rsquo;s Component Store</a> can now declare a dependency on one or more NuGet packages which will be installed into the project when the Component is installed. The <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/view/xamandroidsupportv13-18">Android Support Library v13 Component</a> is one example that has a NuGet package dependency.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentInStore.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component in Component Store&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component in Component Store&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>When you install this Component you will see that it installs the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.Android.Support.v13/">Xamarin.Android.Support.v13 NuGet package</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentInstalledInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component in Solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>In older versions of Xamarin Studio the NuGet package will not be installed and instead the project will reference the Xamarin.Android.Support.v13.dll which is included with the Component.</p>

<p>The NuGet packages a Component depends on are displayed in the <strong>Packages</strong> tab on the Component Details page, which you can open by double clicking the Component in the Solution window, or by right clicking the Component and selecting <strong>Details</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentDetailsWithPackagesTab.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Packages in Component Details page&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Packages in Component Details page&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>From the <strong>Packages</strong> tab you can also install a NuGet package that a Component depends on if it was removed from the project. So if the Xamarin.Android.Support.v13 NuGet package is removed from the project the Component will be highlighted in red to indicate that there is a problem.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentErrorInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component error in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component error in Solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you then open the Component Details page you will see in the <strong>Packages</strong> tab that the NuGet package is missing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentDetailsWithMissingNuGetPackage.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component Details page with missing NuGet Package&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 CComponent Details page with missing NuGet Package&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>To add the NuGet package back to the project you can hover the mouse over the warning icon and click the Add Package button that appears in the pop-up window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-5/AndroidSupportLibraryV13ComponentDetailsWithAddPackagePopUpWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Android Support Library v13 Component Details page with Add Package pop-up window&rsquo; &lsquo;Android Support Library v13 CComponent Details page with Add Package pop-up window&rsquo;" ></p>

    <updated>2014-09-29T19:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/09/29/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>New Feature</h2>

<ul>
<li> Added support for the new Unified target frameworks for iOS and Mac

<ul>
<li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
<li>Xamarin.Mac</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>More details on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.4 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.4/xamarin.studio_5.4/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>New Unified iOS and Mac Target Frameworks</h2>

<p>Xamarin recently announced <a href="http://blog.xamarin.com/unified-api-with-64-bit-support-for-ios-and-mac/">a new Unified API for its iOS and Mac products</a>. This new Unified API makes it easier to share code between Mac and iOS as well as allowing you to support 32 and 64 bit applications with the same binary.</p>

<p>To use this new Unified API you can create a new Unified project for iOS, or for Mac, using one of the project templates available from Xamarin Studio&rsquo;s New Project Dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-4/UnifiedMacAndIOSProjectsInNewProjectDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Unified iOS and Mac Projects in New Project Dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Unified iOS and Mac Projects in New Project Dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>These Unified projects now support MSBuild and use the following target frameworks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Xamarin.iOS</li>
<li>Xamarin.Mac</li>
</ul>


<h2>NuGet Support for the New Unified Target Frameworks</h2>

<p>In order to support these two new frameworks the following changes were made to NuGet.</p>

<ul>
<li>Add Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Mac as known frameworks.</li>
<li>Make frameworks that have a name that starts with <strong>Xamarin</strong> optional when checking the compatibility of Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) inside a NuGet package with a Portable Class Library project.</li>
</ul>


<p>With these new Unified frameworks being recognised by NuGet you can now create a NuGet package with assemblies that specifically target these frameworks.  The following shows part of a .nuspec file with framework specific assemblies for iOS and Mac being copied into the appropriate target lib folder inside the NuGet package.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;files&gt;
    &lt;file src="lib\Xamarin.iOS\*.dll" target="lib\Xamarin.iOS10" /&gt;
    &lt;file src="lib\Xamarin.Mac\*.dll" target="lib\Xamarin.Mac20" /&gt;
&lt;/files&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Splat/">Splat NuGet package</a>, created by Paul Betts, is one NuGet package available from the main NuGet gallery that explicitly targets both of the new Unified frameworks.</p>

<p>Having the Xamarin frameworks treated as optional by NuGet allows you to install a NuGet package containing PCL assemblies into a Portable Class Library project, on a machine with the Xamarin PCL profiles registered. Without the Xamarin frameworks being treated as optional the NuGet package would fail to be installed since NuGet would find them incompatible unless the NuGet package explicitly included the Xamarin frameworks as part of its PCL profile.</p>

<p>Support for the new Xamarin frameworks will be available in the official NuGet from Microsoft in version 2.8.3. <a href="https://nuget.codeplex.com/releases/view/133091">NuGet 2.8.3</a> is currently available as alpha release. Xamarin Studio 5.4 includes its own build of NuGet which has support for the new Xamarin frameworks.</p>

<h2>Portable Class Libraries</h2>

<p>In order to be able to install a NuGet package containing PCL assemblies, such as Json.NET, into a Unified iOS or Unified Mac project you will need to have the PCL profile XML files for Unified iOS and Mac installed on your machine.</p>

<p>On the Mac you can get these new PCL profile XML files by installing Mono 3.10.0, which is currently available from Xamarin Studio on the alpha and beta channels.</p>

<p>On Windows, since NuGet 2.8.3 is currently only available as an alpha release, there is a <a href="http://xvs.xamarin.com/Xamarin.iOS.PortableNuGet.msi">separate installer</a> which will register the Unified iOS framework with the PCL profiles on your machine and will also install an alpha version of Microsoft&rsquo;s NuGet Package Manager 2.8.3 into Visual Studio.</p>

<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.3 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.3/xamarin.studio_5.3/">release notes</a>. Now let us take a more detailed look at the new NuGet changes.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore no longer uses NuGet.exe</h2>

<p>The NuGet package restore is now a part of Xamarin Studio and no longer uses NuGet.exe. This allows the package restore to integrate with the Xamarin Studio credential provider and provides more control over the package restore process. So if a package source needs authentication, or uses a proxy, then Xamarin Studio will now show a dialog asking for credentials if the credentials are not stored. Previously the package restore would fail with an error message logged in the Package Console.</p>

<h2>Add Packages dialog &ndash; Package sources could not be reached</h2>

<p>Previously when All Sources was selected and if any package source could not be reached then an error message would be displayed and no packages would be shown in the list. Now packages will be displayed with a warning even if one package source could not be reached.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-3/AddPackagesDialogPackageSourcesCouldNotBeReachedWarning.png" title="&lsquo;Add Packages dialog &ndash; package sources could not be reached warning&rsquo; &lsquo;Add Packages dialog &ndash; package sources could not be reached warning&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Packages restored for the selected project instead of the solution</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio will now restore packages for the selected project instead of the entire solution. When you right click the <strong>Packages</strong> folder in the Solution window and select <strong>Restore</strong> only the packages for that project will be restored.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-0/SolutionWindowRestorePackagesMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Packages folder &ndash; Restore menu&rsquo; &lsquo;Packages folder &ndash; Restore menu&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This is now possible since Xamarin Studio is now responsible for restoring packages instead of using NuGet.exe which would only restore for the entire solution.</p>

<p>To restore packages for the entire solution you can still use the <strong>Restore Packages</strong> menu which is available from the Project menu or by right clicking the solution in the Solution window.</p>

<h2>Show packages added to solution in Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>Opening the Add Packages dialog will now show the packages added to all projects in the current solution.</p>

<p>The order of the items displayed in the Add Packages dialog is recent packages first, then solution packages, and then the packages from the active package source.</p>

<h2>Show packages up to date message in status bar if there are no package updates available</h2>

<p>When you try to update a package and there are no package updates available then the status bar now displays a message indicating that the package is already up to date.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-3/PackageUpToDateStatusBarMessage.png" title="&lsquo;Package up to date status bar message&rsquo; &lsquo;Package up to date status bar message&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Similarly if you update multiple packages and there are no updates available then the status bar will now show a packages are up to date message.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-3/PackagesAreUpToDateStatusBarMessage.png" title="&lsquo;Packages are up to date status bar message&rsquo; &lsquo;Packages are up to date status bar message&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Previously the status bar would show a message that the package was updated successfully even if nothing was updated.</p>

<h2>Show status bar warning message when no updates found and package sources are unavailable</h2>

<p>When one or more of the package sources is unavailable or invalid then Xamarin Studio will now report a warning in the status bar after checking for updates.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-3/NoUpdateFoundButWarningsReportedStatusBarMessage.png" title="&lsquo;No update but warnings reported status bar message&rsquo; &lsquo;No updated found but warnings reported status bar message&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Restoring missing packages before updating packages</h2>

<p>Previously when NuGet packages were unrestored and an attempt was made to update a NuGet package, which had updates available from the package source, the update would fail with a message indicating that the package was installed successfully but the project did not reference the package.</p>

<p>To prevent the update from failing Xamarin Studio will now check that the packages are restored for the project before trying to update and restore any missing packages. In the status bar a <strong>Restoring packages before update</strong> message will be displayed when a restore must be completed first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-3/RestoringPackagesBeforeUpdateStatusBarMessage.png" title="&lsquo;Restoring packages before update status bar message&rsquo; &lsquo;Restoring packages before update status bar message&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Do not check for updated packages if the project has no packages</strong></p>

<p>Xamarin Studio was checking for package updates in all projects even if they had no packages.config file when the solution was opened. This would result in the <strong>Packages are up to date</strong> message being displayed in the status bar even when no projects were using any NuGet packages.</p>

<p>Now if the project has no packages.config file then Xamarin Studio will not check for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Fix version shown as download count in Add Packages dialog when searching for package versions</strong></p>

<p>When running a package version search, such as <strong>Xamarin.Forms version:</strong>*, the right hand side of the dialog was showing the version number instead of the download count.</p>

<p>Now the dialog shows the download count. Ideally it would show the download count of that particular version but this is not currently available from the Package object returned by NuGet. It is returned in the results back from the package source but it is not available on the Package object.</p>

<p>Also the download counts are different for the same package if you compare the normal search result with a package version search result. The package version search shows a larger download count number. This may be related to the <a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20140603/nuget-stats.html">stats problem</a> NuGet had recently. Currently Xamarin Studio is showing the download count it receives. The standard search download counts match those shown in Visual Studio&rsquo;s Manage Packages dialog. For the package version search the download count value matches that shown on the NuGet.org website for an individual package (e.g. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/jQuery">https://www.nuget.org/packages/jQuery</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Fix empty source being selected in Add Packages dialog when package source disabled and All Sources selected</strong></p>

<p>An empty package source selected in the Add Packages dialog could occur when All Sources was selected in the Add Packages dialog and one of the enabled package sources was unchecked in Preferences. On opening the Add Packages dialog again an empty package source would be displayed as the selected package source.</p>

<p>Now the Add Packages dialog will have the remaining enabled package source selected.</p>

<p><strong>Fix packages.config marked as deleted by Git when updating packages</strong></p>

<p>On updating packages in a project, and the project is using Git for version control, then the update was causing Git to show the packages.config file as deleted. This would occur if all the NuGet packages were uninstalled as part of the update which caused NuGet to see that there were no NuGet packages referenced and delete the packages.config file.</p>

<p>Now the packages.config file is shown as modified instead of deleted.</p>
