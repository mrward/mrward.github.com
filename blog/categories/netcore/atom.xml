<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.3</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-december-4-2017---visual-studio-2017-version-73-730797">release notes</a></p>

<h2>VSTest Console Runner</h2>

<p>Previous versions of Visual Studio for Mac would use <strong>dotnet vstest</strong>,
included with the .NET Core SDK,
to run unit tests for .NET Core projects. Now Visual Studio for Mac includes
the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest">VSTest</a> Console runner and uses that instead of using the .NET Core SDK.</p>

<p>The standalone VSTest Console runner allows other project types, not just .NET Core projects, to
be supported. Visual Studio for Mac can now run <a href="https://xunit.github.io">xUnit</a> tests
for .NET Framework projects. Previously only NUnit was supported.</p>

<p>Let us take a look at using xUnit in a .NET Framework project.</p>

<p>First create a .NET Framework Library project by opening the New Project dialog and selecting
Library from the Other &ndash; .NET &ndash; General category.</p>

<p>Install the following NuGet packages into the project.</p>

<ul>
<li>xunit</li>
<li>xunit.runner.visualstudio</li>
</ul>


<p>Edit MyClass.cs and add some xUnit tests, as shown below:</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>using Xunit;</p>

<p>namespace xUnitTests
{</p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass
{
    [Fact]
    public void PassingTest()
    {
        Assert.True(true);
    }

    [Fact]
    public void FailingTest()
    {
        Assert.False(true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>Building the project should then show the xUnit tests in the Unit Tests window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-3/xUnitTestsInUnitTestsWindow.png" title="&lsquo;xUnit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo; &lsquo;xUnit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Note that, due to a bug in Visual Studio for Mac, the tests may not appear in the
Unit Tests window if the
xunit.runner.visualstudio was not available in the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet
package cache when it was added to the project. Closing and re-opening the
solution should allow the tests to be discovered.</p>

<p>The tests can then be run or debugged in the usual way.</p>

<p>Currently MSTest is not yet supported in .NET Framework projects. The tests are discovered
but they fail to run with an access denied error message:</p>

<pre><code>An exception occurred while invoking executor 'executor://mstestadapter/v2': 
Access to the path "/TestResults" is denied.
</code></pre>

<h2>Renamed ASP.NET Core Project Templates</h2>

<p>The ASP.NET Core template names displayed in the New Project dialog
have been changed to be more consistent with Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)&rsquo; renamed to &lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App&rsquo;</li>
<li>&lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App&rsquo; renamed to &lsquo;ASP.NET Core Web App (MVC)&rsquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Visual Studio uses (Model-View-Controller) but the shorter
MVC is used by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<h2>New ASP.NET Core F# Project Templates Added</h2>

<p>The following ASP.NET Core F# project templates are now available from the
New Project dialog.</p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET Core Empty

<ul>
<li>.NET Core 1.x and 2.0</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ASP.NET Core Web API

<ul>
<li>.NET Core 2.0 only</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Support Backslash in Project Template Primary Output Path</h2>

<p>The template.json file used by the new templating engine uses a
primaryOutputs property for projects and files. If the paths used
contained backslashes then the project was not added to the
solution.</p>

<p><code>
"primaryOutputs": [
  { "path": "Library1\\Library1.csproj" },
  { "path": "Library2\\Library2.csproj" }
]
</code></p>

<p>Now the paths have the backslashes replaced with forward slashes if
the current platform does not support backslash as a path
separator.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders MSBuild property is
read and appended to the list of fallback folders stored in the
project.assets.json file. The .NET Core 2.0 SDK will set this
MSBuild property to point to the NuGet package fallback folder
that is installed with the SDK. This will be used
to resolve NuGet packages first before downloading them to the
~/.nuget/packages folder.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property can be used
to add additional package sources to the existing list of sources
used to resolve packages.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestoreFallbackFolders MSBuild property can be used by project that uses
PackageReferences to define a set of package fallback folders that
will override any specified in the NuGet.Config file. It can also
be used to clear any pre-defined fallback folders by specifying
&lsquo;clear&rsquo; as its value. Note that this value does not affect any
folders defined by RestoreAdditionalProjectFallbackFolders which
will be appended even if RestoreFallbackFolders is set to &lsquo;clear&rsquo;.</p>

<h2>Support RestorePackagesPath MSBuild Property</h2>

<p>The RestorePackagesPath MSBuild property can be used to override the global packages
folder location when a project uses a PackageReference.</p>

<h2>Support RestoreSources MSBuild property</h2>

<p>The RestoreSources MSBuild property can be used to override
the sources defined by any NuGet.Config file. Any sources defined in the
RestoreAdditionalProjectSources MSBuild property will still be appended to the
list of sources if RestoreSources is defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed Transitive Project References not supported</strong></p>

<p>With three .NET Core projects, LibC referencing LibB referencing LibA,
the types defined by LibA were not available to LibC unless it was
directly referencing LibA. In Visual Studio for Mac 7.3 the types
defined by LibA are available to LibC without LibC directly
referencing LibA.</p>

<p><strong>Portable Class Library projects can now be referenced by .NET Core projects</strong></p>

<p>Portable Class Library (PCL) projects could not be referenced by .NET Core
projects or .NET Standard projects. The Edit References dialog would show
&ldquo;Incompatible target framework&rdquo; for the PCL project when trying to add the
reference.</p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac now has the same behaviour as Visual Studio on Windows where
a .NET Standard project can reference any PCL project.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild Update item not removed from project</strong></p>

<p>If a file was deleted from a project, or removed without deleting,
and the file was the last file for a particular wildcard include, the
Update item for the file was not being removed from the project.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild Remove item not added when Update item exists</strong></p>

<p>With a project that contained a single .cs file, and that file had
an Update item defined, when the file was removed from the project,
without deleting it, a Remove item was not being added to the project for the file.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed Remove item not being added when file excluded from project</strong></p>

<p>When the last file was removed from the project, but not deleted, an
MSBuild Remove item was not added to the project for the file.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a .NET Standard 2.0 project.</li>
<li>Right click Class1.cs and select Remove.</li>
<li>Select Remove from Project in the dialog that opens.</li>
<li>Close and re-open solution.</li>
</ol>


<p>The Class1.cs file was still shown in the Solution window when it should have been
removed. The project file did not have a Compile remove item for Class1.cs when it should
have been added:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Remove="Class1.cs" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Deleting a XAML file left an MSBuild Remove item in project file</strong></p>

<p>When a .xaml file in a project was deleted the associated
Remove MSBuild item, if it was present, was not being removed from the
project file.</p>

<ol>
<li> Create a new .NET Standard 2.0 project.</li>
<li> Add Xamarin.Forms 2.3 NuGet package.</li>
<li> Add a new Content Page with Xaml file using the New File dialog.</li>
<li> In the Solution window select the .xaml file and delete it.</li>
</ol>


<p>All MSBuild items associated with the .xaml file should have been
removed from the project file but instead a None item would remain.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="MyPage.xaml" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Fix MSBuild remove item not added when adding a XAML file</strong></p>

<p>Adding a new .xaml file to a project was not adding a None Remove
item for the .xaml file to remove it from the default wildcard include for all
files.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;None Remove="MyNewPage.xaml" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>On reloading the solution the Solution window would show two .xaml
files &ndash; one EmbeddedResource item and one None item.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed MSBuild condition evaluation when using Czech locale</strong></p>

<p>With the primary operating system language set to Czech, creating a new .NET
Core project would result in the project having a target framework of net461.</p>

<p>The problem was that Single.TryParse was returing true for an empty string
when the machine&rsquo;s culture was &lsquo;cs-CZ&rsquo;. This was causing the MSBuild condition
evaluation to be treated as a boolean comparison incorrectly in some cases.
The condition below would return false even though the property was
not defined and both sides of the condition were empty strings:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="'$(TargetFrameworkIdentifier)' == ''"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This was causing the TargetFrameworkIdentifier to not be set for
.NET Core projects so the default of .NETFramework was being used.</p>

<p><strong>Re-evaluate AppliesTo condition on capability change</strong></p>

<p>Fixed the AppliesTo attribute not attaching a project extension to
a project after a NuGet package restore enabled a project capability.
The AppliesTo attribute allows a project extension to be associated
to a project based on its capabilities.</p>

<p>If the project extension uses an AppliesTo attribute which is
initially false and then a new project capability is added, and the
project is re-evaluated, the AppliesTo attribute is now
re-evaluated. This will then cause the project extension to be
attached to the project. If the project extension was attached to the
project and the project capability is removed then the project
extension will now be removed when the project is re-evaluated.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed being unable to run a new Azure Functions project</strong></p>

<p>Creating a new Azure Functions project would result in
being unable to run the project until the solution was closed
and re-opened again. After the NuGet packages are restored the
project can be run but this information was not updated in Visual Studio
for Mac.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package restore, when re-evaluating the project,
the solution startup item is updated if there is no startup item
already defined.</p>

<p>When the project capability is removed, due to a NuGet package
being uninstalled, and the
project can no longer be run the startup item will be updated if
it was previously set to be this project.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Support NuGet package fallback folders</li>
<li> Support AssetTargetFallback</li>
<li> Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support (VS for Mac 7.2.2)</li>
<li> Fixed transitive types from references not being available</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.2</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-october-9-2017---visual-studio-2017-for-mac-720636">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet package fallback folders support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core SDK 2.0 defines a NuGet package fallback folder <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder</code> that can be used when looking
for NuGet packages whilst restoring. This fallback folder is now supported by
Visual Studio for Mac 7.2 so that on restoring a .NET Core 2.0 project the NuGet
packages from the fallback folder will be found and do not need to be downloaded from nuget.org into the
local machine NuGet package cache <code>~/.nuget/packages</code>. This should speed up NuGet package restore for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 projects the first time it occurs.</p>

<p>As well as the NuGet fallback folders Visual Studio for Mac will now add the following items to the generated project.assets.json
if they are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>configFilePaths</li>
<li>sources</li>
<li>warningProperties</li>
</ul>


<h2>AssetTargetFallback support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses an AssetTargetFallback MSBuild property
defined in an imported SDK MSBuild files. This is used instead
of the PackageTargetFallback property when determining if a NuGet
package is compatible. Currently the AssetTargetFallback property
is set to net461 by the .NET Core 2.0 SDK which allows .NET Core projects to use NuGet
packages that include assemblies that target the full .NET Framework.
The supported fallback frameworks are now added to the generated
project.assets.json file by Visual Studio for Mac when a .NET Core 2.0 project is restored.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore now fails if package and asset target fallbacks are defined by a project</h2>

<p>If both AssetTargetFallback and PackageTargetFallback are defined by a project then the
NuGet restore will fail with an error indicating that they cannot
be used together. This mirrors the behaviour of the .NET Core command
line restore.</p>

<h2>Mark implicit PackageReferences as auto referenced</h2>

<p>PackageReference items that have IsImplicitlyDefined set to true
in their metadata now have autoRefererenced set to true in the project.assets.json file.</p>

<h2>Support parsing MSBuild conditions with unquoted properties</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses conditions that pass properties to the
Exists function without using single quotes around the MSBuild property.
This is now supported by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="Exists($(FileName))"&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support</h2>

<p>The following sections cover bug fixes made in Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.2
to improve support for <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/xamarin-forms/xamarin-forms-2.4/2.4.0-stable/">Xamarin.Forms 2.4</a> and later versions. Xamarin.Forms 2.4 includes .NET Standard support as well as defining default MSBuild items for
.NET Core and .NET Standard projects. These default MSBuild items were not
handled by Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.0 and earlier versions. The main symptoms of Visual Studio for Mac not supporting Xamarin.Forms 2.4 were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicate .xaml files in the Solution window.</li>
<li>Nesting of .xaml and .xaml.cs files not working in Solution window.</li>
<li>MSBuild items incorrectly added to SDK style projects.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Generated NuGet files being imported twice</h3>

<p>The generated NuGet files, .nuget.g.targets and .nuget.g.props,
that are created for .NET Core projects were being imported twice.
Once by Microsoft.Common.props, that is provided with Mono, and once
by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>This double import was causing a duplicate file
to be added to the
project when Xamarin.Forms 2.4
was used in a .NET Standard project and the .NET Core SDK was not
installed. This would result in the .xaml file and associated
.xaml.cs file not being nested in the solution window.</p>

<h3>MSBuild items added when new xaml file added to project</h3>

<p>Adding a new Xamarin.Forms content page with XAML would incorrectly add an
update item to the project for the .xaml.cs file when an SDK style project
was used.</p>

<p>When a new .xaml file was added to an SDK style project a None item as well as an EmbeddedResource item would incorrectly be added to the project file.</p>

<p>```
<None Remove="MyView.xaml" /></p>

<p><EmbeddedResource Include="MyView.xaml">
  <Generator>MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXaml"</Generator>
</EmbeddedResource>
```</p>

<h3>Compile item added with DependentUpon metadata</h3>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines a wildcard update similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When a project was saved in Visual Studio for Mac a Compile item was
incorrectly added to the main project with the evaluated value stored in the
DependentUpon element.</p>

<h3>DependentUpon being evaluated incorrectly</h3>

<p>Metadata defined for wildcard MSBuild items were being evaluated using
the wildcard item instead of the expanded item. This
was causing .xaml.cs files to not be nested in the Solution window
for Xamarin.Forms 2.4.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines an update item similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The DependentUpon property was evaluated using the wildcard item
which resulted in the DependentUpon property being
evaluated as &lsquo;*.xaml.cs&rsquo; instead of the filename of the item that was
updated by the wildcard.</p>

<h3>Define MSBuildSDKsPath for MSBuild engine host</h3>

<p>MSBuild when run on the command line defines the MSBuildSDKsPath in
its MSBuild.dll.config file. The MSBuild engine host that is used
when building with Visual Studio for Mac now also defines the MSBuildSDKsPath property. Previously this was not being defined.</p>

<p>This fixes a build error when using Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 in an SDK style
project that targets .NET Standard. Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 uses default
item imports which were not being included since they are conditionally
imported based on the MSBuildSDKsPath property value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Forms.DefaultItems.props" 
    Condition="'$(MSBuildSDKsPath)'!=''" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the SDK style project had a .xaml file and a .xaml.cs file then
the .xaml.g.cs file was not being generated when the project had no files
explicitly defined in the project file. This
then caused a build error about the InitializeComponent method not
being defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive assembly references not available until restart</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC
references LibB which references LibA. If the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet
package was installed into LibA the types from this NuGet package
were not available in LibB or LibC until the solution was closed and
re-opened again. Closing and re-opening the solution refreshes the
reference information used by the type system. Now when a NuGet
package is installed into a .NET Core project the projects that
reference this project have their reference information refreshed. Types from
the installed NuGet packages are then available in projects that
reference this updated project either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive project references after editing a project file</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC references
LibB which references LibA. If a NuGet package is added to LibA by
editing its project file in the text editor the types from this NuGet
package were not available to LibB or LibC without restarting Visual Studio
for Mac or until the packages were restored for the solution. Now when the project file
is saved the projects that directly or indirectly reference the project
will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore project references with ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false when restoring</strong></p>

<p>Project references that have ReferenceOutputAssembly are now not
added to the project.assets.json file. This was causing
the NuGet package restore to fail in some cases. For example, if a .NET Standard
project has a project reference to a .NET Core App project, but has the
ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false, then running dotnet restore from the
command line would work, but the restore would fail in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<ul>
<li> .NET Core 2.0 support</li>
<li> Target framework selection for new projects</li>
<li> New project templates</li>
<li> .NET Core Runtimes and SDKs displayed in About Dialog</li>
<li> Improved support for multi target framework projects</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.1</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-august-14-2017---visual-studio-for-mac-7101297">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>.NET Core 2.0 Support</h2>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac 7.1 adds support for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/">.NET Core 2.0</a> and .NET Standard 2.0.</p>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK needs to be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core">installed</a> separately.</p>

<h2>Target Framework Selection for New Projects</h2>

<p>If a project template supports multiple target frameworks, and the corresponding framework is available, then the New Project dialog will allow the framework to be selected before the project is created.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/DotNetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-1/NewNetCoreProjectTargetFrameworkSelection.png" title="&lsquo;New .NET Core target framework selection&rsquo; &lsquo;New .NET Core target framework selection&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac includes project templates for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 as well as for .NET Standard versions 1.0 through to 2.0.</p>

<p>To be able to create projects that target .NET Core 2.0 or .NET Standard 2.0 the .NET Core 2.0 SDK needs to be installed.</p>

<h2>New Project Templates</h2>

<p>The following project templates have been added:</p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)

<ul>
<li>Available if .NET Core 2.0 SDK is installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Class Library

<ul>
<li>Targets .NET Core instead of .NET Standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSTest</li>
</ul>


<p>Some project templates do not support all the target framework versions.
For example, the ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages) only supports
.NET Core 2.0, so this template will only be displayed if .NET Core 2.0 SDK
is installed.</p>

<p>The F# project templates have some restrictions on what target frameworks
they support. The F# .NET Standard project templates do not
support selecting .NET Standard versions below 1.6. The F# Class Library project
only supports .NET Core 2.0.</p>

<h2>.NET Core Runtime and SDKs displayed in About Dialog</h2>

<p>The About dialog will now display the .NET Core runtimes and SDKs that are installed on
the local machine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/DotNetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-1/NetCoreInformationAboutDialog.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core runtime and SDK information in About dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core runtime and SDK information in About dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Improved Support for Multi Target Framework Projects</h2>

<p>SDK style projects that target multiple frameworks can now be opened in Visual Studio for
Mac 7.1 and will show source files as well as NuGet package dependencies.</p>

<p>The project will be treated as though it only has
one target framework which is the first one specified in the
TargetFrameworks property in the project file.</p>

<p>Please note that currently the support for multiple target frameworks is limited in
comparison with Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>ASP.NET Core Web API project does not open API url on launching browser</strong></p>

<p>When an ASP.NET Core Web API project was run it would open a blank web
page in the browser instead of a page that showed the api values. Now when a new ASP.NET
Core Web API project is run the <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/api/values</code> url is launched in
the browser so the API values will be displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to run or debug ASP.NET Core project with empty SDK directory</strong></p>

<p>If there was an empty directory inside the .NET Core SDK directory <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk</code> then it was
not possible to run or debug an ASP.NET Core web project</p>

<p>If the .NET Core SDK MSBuild files were not found in the SDK directory then the
project&rsquo;s OutputType was not read and would result in the project being treated
as a library project. This could also occur if only
the .NET Core runtime is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Shared project files shown for .NET Core project in Solution window</strong></p>

<p>When a .NET Core project referenced a shared assets project the files
from the shared project were incorrectly being displayed in the .NET Core project in
the Solution window.</p>

<p><strong>Fix generated code for resource files in .NET Core projects</strong></p>

<p>Adding a resx file to a .NET Core 1.x or .NET Standard 1.x project would result in
code being generated that could not be compiled.</p>

<p>Projects that target .NET Core App 1.0, 1.1, or .NET Standard below version 2.0
cannot compile code that uses <code>typeof(Resources).Assembly</code> which was
being generated by the ResXFileCodeGenerator. If these target frameworks
are used by the project then the code generated by Visual Studio for Mac
will now use <code>typeof(Resources).GetTypeInfo().Assembly</code> which is supported.</p>

<p>.NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 do not need to use GetTypeInfo so the
code generated for these frameworks has not been changed.</p>

<p><strong>Fix new resource file not added as Update item in Sdk projects</strong></p>

<p>Adding a new resource file to a .NET Core project would add the
.resx file and the .Designer.cs file as Include items instead of an
Update items.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;EmbeddedResource Include="Resources.resx"&gt;
    &lt;Generator&gt;ResXFileCodeGenerator&lt;/Generator&gt;
    &lt;LastGenOutput&gt;Resources.Designer.cs&lt;/LastGenOutput&gt;
  &lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Compile Include="Resources.Designer.cs"&gt;
    &lt;DependentUpon&gt;Resources.resx&lt;/DependentUpon&gt;
  &lt;/Compile&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This then caused the build to fail since these files are already included by
the .NET Core SDK.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest version of the .NET Core addin for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop now supports <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test">.NET Core Test Runners</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/DotNetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Xamarin Studio uses the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/tools/test-protocol">.NET Core test communication protocol</a> to support .NET Core test runners. This protocol provides a way to discover and run the unit tests provided by a .NET Core test runner.</p>

<p>When Xamarin Studio finds a testRunner in the project.json file it will attempt to discover the unit tests for that project.</p>

<pre><code>{
    "version": "1.1.0-*",

    "testRunner": "nunit",

    "dependencies": {,
        "NUnit": "3.4.0",
        "dotnet-test-nunit": "3.4.0-beta-1"
    },

    "frameworks": {
        "netcoreapp1.0": {
            "imports": [
                "netcoreapp1.0",
                "portable-net45+win8"
            ],
            "dependencies": {
                "Microsoft.NETCore.App": {
                    "version": "1.0.0-*",
                    "type": "platform"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The discovered tests are then shown in the Unit Tests window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/DotNetCoreDiscoveredUnitTestsInUnitTestsWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Discovered NET Core unit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo; &lsquo;Discovered NET Core unit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>After building the project the Unit Tests window will discover any new tests that have been added.</p>

<p>Tests can be run by clicking Run All or by right clicking a test in the Unit Tests window and selecting Run Test.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/RunDotNetCoreTestsContextMenu.png" title="&lsquo;Run NET Core unit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo; &lsquo;Run NET Core unit tests in Unit Tests window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The test results are shown in the Test Results window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/DotNetCoreTestResultsWindow.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core test results  in Test Results window&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core test results  in Test Results window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Console output from the test runner is shown in the Application Output window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NetCoreTestRunnerSupportInXamarinStudio/DotNetCoreTestRunnerApplicationOutput.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core Test Runner in Xamarin Studio&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Debugging the unit tests is not yet supported.</p>

<p><a href="https://xunit.github.io/">xUnit</a> and <a href="http://nunit.org/">NUnit</a> provide .NET Core test runners and both of these are supported in Xamarin Studio. More information can be found in existing tutorials on how to use these test runners:</p>

    <updated>2016-06-05T19:02:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2016/06/05/AspNetCoreRC2SupportInXamarinStudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop now have support for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/05/16/announcing-asp-net-core-rc2/">ASP.NET Core 1.0 RC2</a> with an alpha release of the <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-dnx-addin">.NET Core addin</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/AspNetCoreRC2SupportInXamarinStudio/WebProjectInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;ASP.NET Core web project in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;ASP.NET Core web project in Solution window&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This is an update of the original <a href="/blog/2016/01/01/DNXSupportInXamarinStudio/">DNX addin</a> which adds support for .NET Core RC2 and also, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidkarlas">David Karlaš</a>, adds support for debugging .NET Core applications on the Mac.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> Debugging .NET Core applications with the .NET Core CLR on Mac.</li>
<li> Project templates for console, library and web applications</li>
<li> Code completion</li>
<li> NuGet integration</li>
<li> Solution window integration</li>
</ul>


<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li> MonoDevelop and Xamarin Studio 6.0 (build 5166). (Note that 6.1 is not yet supported)</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">.NET Core 1.0 RC2</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Installing .NET Core SDK</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">.NET Core SDK</a> needs to be installed separately before using the .NET Core addin. Detailed installation instructions can be found on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/core">Microsoft&rsquo;s .NET Core web site</a>.</p>

<h2>Installing the addin</h2>

<p>The addin is currently available from <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop&rsquo;s Add-in Repository</a> in the alpha channel. In Xamarin Studio open the Add-in Manager and select the Gallery tab. Click the repository drop down and if <strong>Xamarin Studio Add-in Repository (Alpha Channel)</strong> is not displayed then click Manage Repositories. In the window that opens tick the check box next to Xamarin Studio Add-in Repository (Alpha Channel) and then click the Close button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/AspNetCoreRC2SupportInXamarinStudio/AddinManagerNetCoreAddin.png" title="&lsquo;.NET Core addin selected in Addin Manager dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;.NET Core addin selected in Addin Manager dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Select the .NET Core addin and then click the Install button.</p>

<p>After installing the .NET Core addin you will need to restart Xamarin Studio before the project templates are available in the New Project dialog.</p>

<h2>Creating a .NET Core project</h2>

<p>There are three project templates available for .NET Core in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/AspNetCoreRC2SupportInXamarinStudio/NewProjectDialogNetCoreProjectTemplates.png" title="&lsquo;New ASP.NET 5 project templates&rsquo; &lsquo;New ASP.NET 5 project templates&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidkarlas">David Karlaš</a> there is a support for debugging .NET Core applications when running on the .NET Core CLR if you have the <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/Project/Index/228">VSCode Debugger addin</a> installed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/AspNetCoreRC2SupportInXamarinStudio/DebuggingNetCoreApplication.png" title="&lsquo;Debugging a .NET Core application&rsquo; &lsquo;Debugging a .NET Core application&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>The VSCode Debugger addin is currently available from <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop&rsquo;s Add-in Repository</a> on the alpha channel.</p>

<p>Debugging .NET Core console and web projects that target the full .NET framework is supported on all platforms. The .NET Core command line tool (dotnet.exe) will create an executable when targeting the full .NET Framework which can be debugged in Xamarin Studio. On Windows the x86 version of the .NET Core SDK needs be installed since Xamarin Studio currently cannot debug x64 applications on Windows.</p>

<h2>Source Code</h2>

<p>The source code for the addin is available on GitHub.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-dnx-addin">.NET Core addin source code</a>.</li>
</ul>
