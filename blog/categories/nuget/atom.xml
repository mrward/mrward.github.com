    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 2.8.5 support</li>
<li> NuGet warning and error messages in Status Bar</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the changes in Xamarin Studio 5.9.2 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.9/xamarin.studio_5.9/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 2.8.5 support</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio now supports NuGet 2.8.5.</p>

<p>NuGet 2.8.5 adds support for three new .NET target frameworks: DNX, DNXCore and Core.</p>

<p>With NuGet 2.8.5 supported you can now install the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/xunit/2.1.0-beta2-build2981">latest pre-release version of xUnit</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet warning and error messages in Status Bar.</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio 5.9 has a new native Status Bar on the Mac. This new Status Bar has a smaller width so the NuGet warning and error messages could be too long to be displayed. The screenshots below show a NuGet warning and error message in Xamarin Studio 5.9 that do not fit in the Status Bar.</p>

<p>In Xamarin Studio 5.9.2 the NuGet Status Bar messages have been shortened so they can be displayed in the new Status Bar without being truncated. The screenshots below show the new format of the NuGet warning and error messages shown in the Status Bar.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 2.8.3 support</li>
<li> Always show Packages folder in Solution window</li>
<li> Target framework change detected on project reload</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.9 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.9/xamarin.studio_5.9/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 2.8.3 support</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio now supports NuGet 2.8.3. This allows a NuGet package to target NuGet 2.8.3 explicitly. For example the PCLStorage 1.0.1 NuGet package will not install into Xamarin Studio 5.8, since it requires NuGet 2.8.3, but will install into Xamarin Studio 5.9.</p>

<p>NuGet packages, such as xunit, that target the new ASP.NET target frameworks, ASP.NetCore 5.0 and ASP.Net 5.0, can now be installed into Xamarin Studio now that it supports NuGet 2.8.3. Previously you would see an error message in the Package Console window:</p>

<pre><code>'xunit.core' already has a dependency defined for 'xunit.extensibility.core'.
</code></pre>

<p>Support for NuGet 2.8.5 is planned for Xamarin Studio 5.9.1.</p>

<h2>Always Show Packages Folder in Solution window</h2>

<p>The Packages folder is now always shown in the Solution window even if the project has no NuGet packages. Previously the Packages folder would only be shown if one or more NuGet packages were installed in a project.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-9/PackagesFolderInSolutionWindow.png" title="&lsquo;Packages folder in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;Packages folder in Solution window&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Target Framework Change Detected on Project Reload</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio will detect a project file has been changed outside of Xamarin Studio and will reload the project. Now Xamarin Studio on reloading will detect the project&rsquo;s target framework has been changed and will  check the NuGet packages are compatible with the new target framework. Previously Xamarin Studio would only check the compatibility of NuGet packages if the target framework was changed from within Xamarin Studio via the project options.</p>

<p>This allows Xamarin Studio to check the NuGet packages are compatible when an iOS Classic project is converted to an iOS Unified project using Xamarin Studio&rsquo;s migration tool. The NuGet packages, such as Xamarin.Forms, can then be retargeted by Xamarin Studio using the <a href="blog/2014/08/10/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-2/">Retarget menu</a>.</p>

    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2015/03/21/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-8</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xamarin Studio 5.8 <a href="http://blog.xamarin.com/xamarin-releases-watch-kit-support-like-clockwork/">added support for Apple&rsquo;s Watch Kit</a> and it also includes some NuGet bug fixes.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Allow ASP.NET project templates to work offline.</li>
<li> Build error after updating Xamarin.Forms in a project created by Visual Studio</li>
<li> Custom MSBuild task not updated after updating Xamarin.Forms</li>
<li> Update information in the Solution window incorrect after updating packages</li>
<li> Check for package updates continues after closing a solution</li>
<li> Check for package updates prevents packages from being removed</li>
<li> Incorrect error message displayed when checking for package updates</li>
<li> Exception when checking for package updates after changing target framework of a project</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 5.8 can be found in the <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_5.8/xamarin.studio_5.8/">release notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Allow ASP.NET project templates to work offline</strong></p>

<p>Previously it was not possible to create an ASP.NET project without an internet connection even if all the NuGet packages were available in the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet packages cache.</p>

<p>Now the local machine&rsquo;s NuGet cache is used as the primary source of packages for project templates so it is possible to create an ASP.NET project without an internet connection if the NuGet packages are already in this cache.</p>

<p>This problem did not affect project templates, such as Xamarin.Forms, which include the NuGet packages with their project templates.</p>

<p><strong>Build error after updating Xamarin.Forms in a project created by Visual Studio</strong></p>

<p>When a NuGet package that uses custom MSBuild targets file, such as Xamarin.Forms, is added to a project by Visual Studio the project file has an extra Target added, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Target Name="EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports" BeforeTargets="PrepareForBuild"&gt;
  &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;
    &lt;ErrorText&gt;This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer.
Enable NuGet Package Restore to download them.  For more information, see
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=322105. The missing file is {0}.&lt;/ErrorText&gt;
  &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
  &lt;Error Condition="!Exists('packages\Xamarin.Forms.1.2.1.6229\build\portable-win+net45+wp80+MonoAndroid10+MonoTouch10\Xamarin.Forms.targets')" Text="$([System.String]::Format('$(ErrorText)', 'packages\Xamarin.Forms.1.2.1.6229\build\portable-win+net45+wp80+MonoAndroid10+MonoTouch10\Xamarin.Forms.targets'))" /&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When the project was opened in a previous version of Xamarin Studio, and the NuGet package is updated or removed, the Error task was not updated. The project would then fail to compile with an error being reported that the old .targets file could not be found.</p>

<p>Now when updating or removing a NuGet package the EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target is
checked and the matching Error task will be removed. If there are no remaining Error tasks then the EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target is also removed. This prevents build errors after updating or uninstalling the old
NuGet package from the project.</p>

<p>Note that Xamarin Studio will not add an EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target and will not add Error tasks to a project when a NuGet package is added or updated.</p>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild task not updated after updating Xamarin.Forms</strong></p>

<p>If a project that had a reference to Xamarin.Forms was compiled once, then the NuGet package was updated, the old MSBuild task was still being used when compiling.</p>

<p>For Xamarin.Forms this could cause a &ldquo;XamlG Task failed unexpectedly&rdquo; build error to be reported. Also the Package Console would report not being able to access the Xamarin.Forms.Build.Tasks.dll when updating or removing the NuGet package.</p>

<p>The problem was that MonoDevelop.Projects.Formats.MSBuild.exe that compiles the project would lock the MSBuild task assembly.</p>

<p>Now when an MSBuild import is removed on updating a NuGet package Xamarin Studio will dispose the current project builder which will shutdown the MonoDevelop.Projects.Formats.MSBuild.exe process. This unlocks any custom MSBuild task assemblies loaded by this process,
allowing the old NuGet package to be removed without any access denied errors, and when the project is recompiled again it will use the correct MSBuild task assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Update information in the Solution window incorrect after updating packages</strong></p>

<p>With check for updates enabled in Preferences, when an ASP.NET project is created, updates are shown as available for several packages. When
the packages are updated the Solution window would still show updates as being available even though the packages had been updated.</p>

<p>The problem was that a change was made in Xamarin Studio 5.7 to update package dependencies at the same time as the package was updated. This meant that an update event was not fired for each
package being updated which would result in some package updates being shown as available in the Solution window even when they had been updated.</p>

<p>Now Xamarin Studio will check all package references when a package is updated so if any package dependencies are updated the Solution
window will show the correct status of the packages.</p>

<p><strong>Check for package updates continues after closing a solution</strong></p>

<p>Xamarin Studio will now stop checking for package updates when the current solution is closed. Previously this would continue until the check was completed.</p>

<p><strong>Check for updates prevents packages from being removed</strong></p>

<p>Previously when Xamarin Studio was checking for package updates all other NuGet actions, such as updating, adding or removing packages, would not be run until the check for updates had completed.
Now the check for NuGet package updates is done on a separate thread so other NuGet actions can be run at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect error message displayed when checking for package updates</strong></p>

<p>The Package Console would sometimes show the error message &ldquo;An exception was thrown while dispatching a method call in the UI thread.&rdquo; instead of the underlying error making it difficult to determine the cause of the problem.
For example if there was a zero byte sized .nupkg file in the solution&rsquo;s package directory, and check for updates is enabled, then
the wrong error was displayed in the Package Console.</p>

<p><strong>Exception when checking for package updates after changing target framework of a project</strong></p>

<p>Previously a null reference exception would be reported in the Package console window when doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li> Create a project with one NuGet package added.</li>
<li> Create two NuGet package sources in Preferences. Disable all other package sources.</li>
<li> Open the Add Packages dialog and select All Sources.</li>
<li> Go back to Preferences and uncheck both of the package sources.</li>
<li> Change the target framework of the project in the project options.</li>
</ol>

<h2>NuGet menus renamed</h2>

<p>The menus have been changed so they now include the word NuGet to make them easier to discover.</p>

<h3>Project menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/ProjectMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the main Project menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the main Project menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Solution context menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionContextMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Solution context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Solution context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h3>Project context menu</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/ProjectContextMenuNuGetMenuItems.png" title="&lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Project context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;NuGet menu items in the Project context menu&rsquo; &lsquo;&rsquo;" ></p>

<h2>Solution Window</h2>

<p>The warning icon used in the Solution window has been changed so it is consistent with other Solution window items.</p>

<h3>Package not restored</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageMissing.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored&rsquo;" ></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageMissingWithTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored with tooltip&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package not restored with tooltip&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A new warning icon is used for packages that are not restored, the text is greyed out and hovering over the warning icon shows information about the warning.</p>

<h3>Package installing</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageInstalling.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package installing&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package installing&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>When a package is being installed the text is greyed out to indicate that the package is not currently available in the project and the text shows (installing) to distinguish between a package being installed and a package that is not restored.</p>

<h3>Package needs retargeting</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio5-7/SolutionWindowNuGetPackageNeedsRetargetingWithTooltip.png" title="&lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package needs retargeting&rsquo; &lsquo;Solution Window &ndash; NuGet package needs retargeting&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>A new warning icon is used for packages that need retargeting. The package id text has changed to black text instead of orange. Hovering over warning icon shows a message that the package needs retargeting.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Build errors after MSBuild target restored for package</strong></p>

<p>If a NuGet package had an MSBuild target that added extra references to the project then on restoring the
NuGet package those references were still unavailable and the build would still fail.</p>

<p>This problem occurs with the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package. The MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package has a custom MSBuild .targets file that adds extra references:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Project ToolsVersion="4.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&gt;
  &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="MonoGame.Framework"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\MonoGame.Framework.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="Tao.Sdl"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\Tao.Sdl.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
    &lt;Reference Include="OpenTK"&gt;
      &lt;HintPath&gt;$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)\OpenTK.dll&lt;/HintPath&gt;
    &lt;/Reference&gt;
  &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;/Project&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package is not available on opening the
project in Xamarin Studio the project will fail to build after
restoring the NuGet package since the references in the MSBuild targets file were not being refreshed.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package restore the MSBuild host used by Xamarin Studio is
refreshed which allows the references in the MSBuild targets file to be found and the project to compile without any build errors.</p>

<p><strong>Types imported by MSBuild target not recognised after NuGet package installed</strong></p>

<p>If a NuGet package had an MSBuild target that added extra references to the project then on installing the
NuGet package the types from those references were still unavailable to Xamarin Studio and would be highlighted in red
in the text editor. To fix this the solution had to be closed and re-opened. This problem occurs with the MonoGame.Binaries NuGet package.</p>

<p>Now after a NuGet package is installed and it contains a MSBuild targets
file then Xamarin Studio&rsquo;s type system will be refreshed for that project. The
types will then be known by Xamarin Studio and no longer be highlighted in red in the text editor.</p>

<p><strong>Solution window cannot be opened when access to NuGet.Config is denied</strong></p>

<p>If the NuGet directory containing the NuGet.Config file cannot be created or read by NuGet then an exception is thrown. This exception was not being handled by Xamarin Studio and would prevent the
solution window from opening.</p>

<p>Now if there is any error creating this
directory, or trying to load the NuGet.Config file, then the exception is caught which allows the Solution window to open. If the NuGet directory containing the NuGet.Config file cannot be created then it will not be possible to use NuGet in Xamarin Studio but it will not prevent the solution pad from being used.</p>

<p><strong>Updating all packages not updating dependencies</strong></p>

<p>Updating NuGet packages for the entire solution would not install the Xamarin.Android.Support.v13 NuGet package which was added as a new dependency to the Xamarin.Android.Support.v4 NuGet package.</p>

<p>The problem was that the NuGet package update was not configured to update any
NuGet package dependencies when updating all packages in the solution.
Updating all packages in the project or the NuGet package individually
would update package dependencies correctly.</p>

<p>Note that this fix has introduced a bug where Xamarin Studio will show updates as available even though the updates have just been installed for the solution. This new bug should be fixed in Xamarin Studio 5.8.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-release NuGet package being downgraded on update</strong></p>

<p>When a pre-release NuGet package was installed that was newer than the latest stable NuGet package available then updating the package would install the stable version even though it was a lower version. Now an explicit check is made to ensure that an older NuGet package is not being installed.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Installing Portable Class Libraries for Xamarin Studio]]></title>
    <link href="http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/11/16/InstallingPortableClassLibrariesForXamarinStudio/"/>
    <updated>2014-11-16T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2014/11/16/InstallingPortableClassLibrariesForXamarinStudio</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In order to use Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) with Xamarin Studio you need to have the following installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Portable Class Library Reference Assemblies.</li>
<li>Portable Class Library MSBuild targets.</li>
<li>Xamarin&rsquo;s Portable Class Library Profiles.</li>
</ul>


<p>If you do not all of the above installed then you may run into the following problems when using Xamarin Studio.</p>

<ol>
<li>Unable to create a Portable Library project since the project template is not available.</li>
<li><p>Unable to install a NuGet package, such as Json.NET, that contains PCL assemblies into an Android or iOS project. Example error message below:</p>

<p>Could not install package &lsquo;Newtonsoft.Json 6.0.6&rsquo;. You are trying to install this package into a project that targets &lsquo;MonoAndroid,Version=v4.4&rsquo;, but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. For more information, contact the package author.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>On the Mac the Portable Class Libraries for Mono 3.10.0 are installed into the directory:</p>

<pre><code>/Library/Frameworks/Mono.framework/Versions/3.10.0/lib/mono/xbuild-frameworks/.NETPortable
</code></pre>

<p>On Windows the Portable Class Libraries are installed into the directory:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable
</code></pre>

<p>So let us take a look at how to install everything required to get PCLs fully supported within Xamarin Studio.</p>

<h2>Mac &ndash; Installing Portable Class Libraries</h2>

<p>The Portable Class Libraries are included with the <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/download/">Mono Development Kit (MDK)</a> but not with the Mono Runtime Environment (MRE). If you are installing Mono yourself instead of using Xamarin&rsquo;s Universal Installer then you will want to install the MDK instead of the MRE. The MDK includes the MRE as well as extra tools, libraries and the .NET Portable Class Library profiles.</p>

<p>If Mono is updated from within Xamarin Studio using <strong>Check for updates</strong> then the MDK should be installed.</p>

<h2>Windows &ndash; Installing Portable Class Libraries</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio on Windows uses Microsoft&rsquo;s .NET Framework instead of Mono so the Portable Class Libraries need to be installed separately. To install the Portable Class Libraries on Windows you have three options:</p>

<ol>
<li> Install Visual Studio 2013 (full or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=43733">Express version</a>). Update 2 or above is required.</li>
<li> Install the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981/">Portable Library Tools</a> and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40727">Portable Library Reference Assemblies 4.6</a>.</li>
<li> Install the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981/">Portable Library Tools</a> and copy the .NETPortable directory from Mono over to Windows.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you do not want to install Visual Studio 2013 then you should look at options 2 or 3.</p>

<p>One problem with option 2 is that not all the .NET Portable profiles, such as Profile 259, will be installed. The full list of what .NET Portable profiles are installed by each of the installers listed above is available from the <a href="/projects/NuGet/PortableProfiles/">.NET Portable Profiles page</a></p>

<p>Let us take a look in more detail at the option 2 since this has a few manual steps.</p>

<p><strong>Windows &ndash; Installing the Portable Library Tools and the Portable Library Reference Assemblies 4.6</strong></p>

<p>Before you start make sure Xamarin Studio is not running.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b0e0b5e9-e138-410b-ad10-00cb3caf4981/">Portable Library Tools</a>.</p>

<p>To install the Portable Library Tools open a command prompt where PortableLibraryTools.exe was downloaded and run:</p>

<pre><code>PortableLibraryTools /buildmachine
</code></pre>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40727">Portable Library Reference Assemblies 4.6</a> and run the NetFx_PortableLibraryReferenceAssemblies46.msi installer. This will install a PortableReferenceAssemblies.zip file into the directory:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft .NET Portable Library Reference Assemblies 4.6
</code></pre>

<p>This PortableReferenceAssemblies.zip file contains three directories (4.0, 4.5 and 4.6) which need to be extracted and copied into the PCLs directory:</p>

<pre><code> C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable
</code></pre>

<p>The PortableReferenceAssemblies.zip file contains files which already exist in the above folder and you should replace the existing files with the new versions from the .zip file.</p>

<p>If you installed Xamarin Studio before you installed the Portable Class Libraries you will now need to reinstall the Xamarin PCL profiles. The Xamarin PCL profiles will only be installed if the Portable Class Libraries were already installed. The simplest way to do this is to find <strong>Xamarin</strong> in the Control Panel&rsquo;s <strong>Programs and Features</strong>, right click it and select <strong>Repair</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/InstallingPortableClassLibrariesForXamarinStudio/AddRemoveProgramsRepairXamarinInstall.png" title="&lsquo;Repairing Xamarin in Programs and Features&rsquo; &lsquo;Repairing Xamarin in Programs and Features&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>This will add a set of Xamarin .xml files into the profiles that are compatible with the Xamarin frameworks. For example looking at the Profile78 directory we see:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETPortable\v4.5\Profile\Profile78\SupportedFrameworks
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>.NET Framework 4.5.xml</li>
<li>Windows 8.xml</li>
<li>Windows Phone Silverlight 8.xml</li>
<li>Xamarin.Android.xml</li>
<li>Xamarin.iOS.xml</li>
</ul>


<p>Now you should have full support for Portable Class Libraries in Xamarin Studio.</p>
