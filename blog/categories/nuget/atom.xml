<h2>Manage NuGet Packages dialog now uses native macOS UI</h2>

<p>The Manage NuGet Packages dialog is now displayed using Xamarin.Mac.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac8-10/ManageNuGetPackagesDialog.png" title="&lsquo;Manage NuGet packages dialog&rsquo; &lsquo;Manage NuGet packages dialog&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>Previously the dialog was displayed using GTK#.</p>

<p>The following UI changes were also made:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tabs are now used for each page

<ul>
<li>Previously a link was used to select a page</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Search has moved to the same line as the window title</li>
<li>NuGet package sources have moved to the bottom
of the dialog</li>
<li><code>Show pre-release packages</code> check box has been renamed to <code>Include prereleases</code></li>
<li>Hyperlinks that were used to view the license and project pages
have been replaced with buttons</li>
<li>Close button has been removed</li>
</ul>


<h2>NuGet 5.9 support</h2>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-5.9">NuGet 5.9.0.7134</a> is now
included with Visual Studio for Mac 8.10.</p>

<h2>Support disabling NuGet restore in NuGet.Config</h2>

<p>A NuGet.Config file can disable package restore via a enabled setting, as shown below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;packageRestore&gt;
    &lt;add key="enabled" value="false" /&gt;
  &lt;/packageRestore&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is now supported in Visual Studio for Mac and will disable automatic package
restore overriding the setting in Preferences.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed automatic restore may still run if disabled in preferences</strong></p>

<p>Certain actions in SDK style projects, such as saving a project file in the
editor, and adding a reference to another project, would run a package restore even
if automatic restore was disabled in preferences.</p>

<p>Now, if automatic restore is disabled in preferences, no automatic restore
will be run. Restores can still be run from the main menu and the
Solution window.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed $(SolutionDir) not defined when restoring large solution</strong></p>

<p>When a solution contains more than 10 projects then MSBuild is used
directly to restore the projects. If a project was using the SolutionDir
property to import an MSBuild file then this would fail since SolutionDir
is not defined because no solution was being passed to MSBuild.</p>

<p>One way to reproduce this was to have an SDK style project that does not
define a TargetFramework itself but conditionally imports a project,
using a path that includes the $(SolutionDir) property, that defines
the TargetFramework. The NuGet restore would fail with an error about an
invalid framework identifier.</p>

<pre><code>error MSB4018: The “WriteRestoreGraphTask” task failed unexpectedly.
error MSB4018: NuGet.Frameworks.FrameworkException: Invalid
    framework identifier ‘’.
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this Visual Studio for Mac now runs the GenerateRestoreGraphFile
target specifying the solution, not just the projects. This allows
MSBuild to define the $(SolutionDir) property.</p>

<ul>
<li> Fixed implicit NuGet packages being updated</li>
</ul>

can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes">release notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed implicit NuGet packages being updated</strong></p>

<p>Updating all NuGet packages, from the Solution window, in a .NET Core
2.1 project would fail with an error.</p>

<p><code>
Package Microsoft.NETCore.App 2.2.8 is not compatible with netcoreapp2.1 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.1). Package Microsoft NETCore.App 2.2.8 supports: netcoreapp2.2 (.NETCoreApp,Version=v2.2)
</code></p>

<p>The problem was that implicitly defined (or auto-referenced) NuGet
package references were being updated when they should be ignored since
they cannot be updated. Now Visual Studio for Mac does not attempt to
update implicitly defined NuGet package references.</p>

can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Azure DevOps NuGet package source authentication with signed in account</h2>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac now has integrated support for accessing
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/nuget/consume?view=azure-devops">Azure DevOps NuGet package sources</a>
using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/mac/signing-in?view=vsmac-2019">account signed into the IDE</a>
without requiring a personal access token (PAT).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac8-8/AzureDevOps-NuGetPackageSource.gif" title="&lsquo;Azure DevOps NuGet package source prompting for sign in in Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo; &lsquo;Azure DevOps NuGet package source prompting for sign in in Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>If you are not signed in then the
account sign in dialog will be opened when an Azure DevOps NuGet package source
is accessed that requires authentication.</p>

<h2>NuGet 5.8 support</h2>

    <id>http://lastexitcode.com/blog/2020/08/15/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac8-7</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 5.7 support</li>
<li> .NET Core 3.1.401 support

<ul>
<li>Supported in Visual Studio for Mac 8.7.1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> .NET 5 preview 6 and 7 support</li>
<li> Fixed tests not discovered by VS Test adapter for imported NuGet packages</li>
<li> Fixed dependent projects not being restored after project reference added</li>
<li> Fixed SDK resolution errors with vstool</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 8.7</a>
can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2019-mac-relnotes">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 5.7 support</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/NuGet/docs.microsoft.com-nuget/blob/db494772479ae44c2c00d10c9b01b0136bcee892/docs/release-notes/NuGet-5.7.md">NuGet 5.7.0.6702</a> is now
included with Visual Studio for Mac 8.7.</p>

<h2>.NET Core 3.1.401 support</h2>

<p>The NuGet packages shown in the Solution window in the Dependencies folder
would not show child dependencies when .NET Core 3.1.401 SDK
was installed.</p>

<p>The ResolvePackageDependenciesDesignTime MSBuild target&rsquo;s behaviour changed
in .NET Core 3.1.401 to no longer return the full set
of NuGet dependencies and now returns only the top level depdnencies.</p>

<p>The logic that was originally in this design time MSBuild target has been
added to Visual Studio for Mac so the full tree structure of the NuGet
package dependencies can be displayed in the Solution window.</p>

<p>Note that .NET Core 3.1.401 is supported in Visual Studio for Mac 8.7.1</p>

<h2>.NET 5 preview 6 and 7 support</h2>

<p>Restoring an ASP.Core project targeting .NET 5 would fail with an error
when the ResolvePackageAssets task was run.</p>

<p><code>
/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/5.0.100-preview.6.20304.10/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(5,5):
Error MSB4018: The "ResolvePackageAssets" task failed unexpectedly.
System.MissingFieldException: Field not found: string NuGet.ProjectModel.LockFileItem.AliasesProperty Due to: Could not find field in class
  at Microsoft.NET.Build.Tasks.ResolvePackageAssets+CacheWriter.WriteItems[T] (NuGet.ProjectModel.LockFileTarget target, System.Func`2[T,TResult] getAssets, System.Func`2[T,TResult] filter, System.Action`2[T1,T2] writeMetadata) [0x0008e] in &lt;9d95d6a4081d41288f54edb04b336893&gt;:0
</code></p>

<p>NuGet 5.7 introduced a new AliasesProperty to the LockFileItem class. MSBuild in Mono 6.12 uses NuGet 5.6 build tasks which
do not support this new property causing the NuGet restore to fail.</p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac now includes version 5.7 of the NuGet.Build.Tasks assembly and associated
MSBuild targets. These files are copied to Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;s MSBuild host
when it is created and replace these files originally copied from Mono&rsquo;s MSBuild.</p>

<p>Note that .NET 5 preview 8 is not supported by Visual Studio for Mac 8.7 but is supported in by
Visual Studio for Mac 8.8.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed tests not discovered by VS Test adapter for imported NuGet packages</strong></p>

<p>Test adapter NuGet PackageReferences defined in a Directory.Build.props
file were not considered by Visual Studio for Mac.
This resulted in the Unit Tests window not showing any unit tests.
Only when the test adapter PackageReferences were in the main project file
would tests be discovered.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed dependent projects not being restored after project reference added</strong></p>

<p>For a new Blazor Web Assembly project (with ASP.NET Core hosted)
adding a new Razor library project, and having the Client project
reference the library project, would result in build warnings
incorrectly displayed for the
Server project due to conflicts between the NuGet packages used by
the Client because of the new Razor library project reference.</p>

<pre><code>MSB3277: Found conflicts between different versions of "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components" 
</code></pre>

<p>Running a restore for the solution would fix this build warning.</p>

<p>With two SDK style projects referencing each other as follows:</p>

<p>ProjectB &ndash;> ProjectA</p>

<p>If a new SDK project was added, and ProjectA referenced it, the
restore would only occur for ProjectA not ProjectB. This would mean
the Lib project was not available to ProjectB until a restore was
run for ProjectB or for the solution. Depending on the NuGet packages used
this could result in build warnings.</p>

<p>To fix this all the projects, that reference the project which is modified
due to the new project reference, are now restored.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed SDK resolution errors with vstool</strong></p>

<p>vstool is an application that is included with Visual Studio for Mac and provides
a way to run some IDE features from the command line. When one of these features
used a project that required an SDK provided by NuGet it would fail to resolve and download that SDK.</p>

<p>For example, running the following would fail to resolve SDKs provided by NuGet packages.</p>

<pre><code>vstool gettext-update --sort -f:Main.sln
</code></pre>

<p>An error would be reported:</p>

<pre><code>ERROR: Unable to find SDK 'Xamarin.Mac.Sdk'
</code></pre>

<p>The NuGet SDK resolver would fail to find the NuGet.Credentials.dll
causing vstool to fail.</p>

<pre><code>FileNotFoundException Could not load file or assembly 'NuGet.Credentials, Version=5.6.0.5.
</code></pre>

<p>To fix this the NuGet.Credentials.dll is pre-loaded by Visual Studio for Mac so it is
available in the AppDomain when vstool is run.</p>

included with Visual Studio for Mac 8.6.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed escape key not closing Manage NuGet Packages dialog</strong></p>

<p>When the search text box had focus pressing the escape key would
not close the Manage NuGet Packages dialog as it did in previous
versions. A change to fix accessibility of the search text box
broke the original behaviour of the dialog.</p>
