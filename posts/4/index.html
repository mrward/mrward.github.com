  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-template-creator-addin">Template Creator extension</a> provides a way to create a project template from an existing project
or solution open in Visual Studio for Mac and have the project template available in the New
Project dialog straight away.</p>

<p>The Template Creator uses the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating">.NET Core templating engine</a>
to create the projects from the project templates.</p>

<p>Let us take a look in more detail at what the Template Creator extension provides in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> Create a project template from an existing solution or project</li>
<li> Create custom top level project template categories</li>
</ul>


<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Mac 7.0 or later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating a new Project Template</h2>

<p>To create a new project template for a project opened in Visual Studio for Mac,
right click the project and select Create Template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/ProjectCreateTemplateMenu.png" title="Project - Create Template context menu" alt="Project - Create Template context menu"></p>

<p>A Template Information dialog is then opened.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplateInformationDialog.png" title="Template Information dialog" alt="Template Information dialog"></p>

<p>The information in the dialog is used to populate the generated template.json file. Further
details on what the template.json file holds is available in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/templating/wiki/Reference-for-template.json">reference for template.json</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Author

<ul>
<li>Author of the project template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display Name

<ul>
<li>This is the template name displayed in the New Project dialog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Description

<ul>
<li>This is the description displayed in the New Project dialog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Category

<ul>
<li>This is the category in the New Project dialog used by the template.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Short Name

<ul>
<li>This is the short name for the template that can be used from the .NET Core command line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Default Project Name

<ul>
<li>This is the default project name that will be used with the .NET Core command line.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Identity

<ul>
<li>This is the unique id for the template. This should be unique across all custom
project templates.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Group Identity

<ul>
<li>This is typically a substring of the template&rsquo;s Identity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>By default the project template will use the Other &ndash; .NET &ndash; General category in the
New Project dialog. To change the category click the browse button next to the category text
box to open the Template Categories dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplateCategoriesDialog.png" title="Template Categories dialog" alt="Template Categories dialog"></p>

<p>Select the required category and click OK. The selected category will then be updated
in the Template Information dialog.</p>

<p>Click OK to generate the template.json file. The template.json file will be opened
in the text editor. It will also be displayed in the Solution window in the
.template.config folder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/ProjectTemplateJsonFile.png" title="template.json file created for project" alt="template.json file created for project"></p>

<p>The project template is now available in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/CustomProjectTemplateInNewProjectDialog.png" title="Custom project template in New Project dialog" alt="Custom template in New Project dialog"></p>

<h2>Updating a Project Template</h2>

<p>After the project template is created you can modify the original project and its
template.json file as required.</p>

<p>Changes made to the project are available in the New Project dialog immediately.</p>

<p>Changes made to the template.json file are available immediately in the same
instance of Visual Studio for Mac where the template.json file is being edited.</p>

<h2>Multiple Projects in a Template</h2>

<p>A project template may create more than one project. To create a project template
for all projects in the solution right click the solution and select Create Template.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/SolutionCreateTemplateMenu.png" title="Solution - Create Template context menu" alt="Solution - Create Template context menu"></p>

<p>A template.json file will be created in a .template.config directory inside the solution&rsquo;s
directory.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TwoProjectsTemplateJsonFile.png" title="template.json file created for soluton" alt="template.json file created for solution"></p>

<p>Note that in order for the new projects created to use the name specified in the New Project
dialog they should all have a common start to their name. The template.json file&rsquo;s <code>sourceName</code>
will be the part that is replaced with the name of the project specified in the New Project dialog.</p>

<h2>Configuring Registered Project Templates</h2>

<p>The .NET Core templating engine supports project templates in NuGet packages or project templates
that unpackaged in a directory. The Template Creator extension does
not package the project templates into a NuGet package and instead stores a set of directories that
are scanned by the .NET Core templating engine for templates. The set of directories that are
registered can be viewed and updated in the Preferences dialog from the Templates &ndash; Custom Folders section.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/PreferencesCustomFolders.png" title="Preferences dialog - Templates - Custom Folders" alt="Preferences dialog - Templates - Custom Folders"></p>

<p>The templating engine will scan the configured directories and look for all the template.json files
which define the project templates. The project templates found are then made available to the
Visual Studio for Mac&rsquo;s New Project dialog by the Template Creator extension.</p>

<p>When the template.json file is created using the information in the Template Information dialog
the Template Creator extenxion also registers the
project&rsquo;s directory so it will be scanned by the templating engine.</p>

<p>To remove a project
template from the New Project dialog you can either delete the template.json file or
remove the folder from the Custom Folders defined in the Preferences dialog.</p>

<p>If you have an existing set of project templates that use template.json files and are not
in a NuGet package then you can register a single parent directory in the Preferences dialog.</p>

<h2>Custom Categories</h2>

<p>Custom top level categories can be defined for your project templates by adding them in
Preferences &ndash; Templates &ndash; Custom Categories.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/PreferencesCustomCategories.png" title="Preferences dialog - Templates - Custom Categories" alt="Preferences dialog - Templates - Custom Categories"></p>

<p>The Add Top Level Category button will add a new top level category and two child category
levels. The New Project dialog requires three category levels. The ids used should ensure that
the full path to the template&rsquo;s category is unique. For example, with a custom category
<code>custom/net/general</code> there should not be another top level <code>custom</code> category id, but the second
and third level category ids can be re-used in another top level category, such as <code>top/net/general</code>.</p>

<p>The Add Category button will add a single child category to the currently selected category
whilst the Remove button will remove the selected category.</p>

<p>Note that changes to the categories require Visual Studio for Mac to be restarted before they
are visible in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p>Also note that it is not currently possible to extend existing project template categories
using the Template Creator extension.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing Template Problems</h2>

<p>If the template does not appear in the New Project dialog or fails to be created then
you may be able to diagnose the problem by opening the Templating Log window. This is
available from the View &ndash; Pads menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/MainMenuViewPadsTemplatingLog.png" title="Main menu - View - Pads - Templating Log" alt="Main menu - View - Templating Log"></p>

<p>This window will show messages returned from the .NET Core templating engine and any errors
reported by the Template Creator extension.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/TemplateCreatorForVisualStudioMac/TemplatingLogWindow.png" title="Templating Log window" alt="Templating Log window"></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Template Creator extension is available to download from <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-template-creator-addin/releases/download/0.1/MonoDevelop.TemplateCreator_0.1.mpack">GitHub</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Changes</h2>

<ul>
<li> Support NuGet package fallback folders</li>
<li> Support AssetTargetFallback</li>
<li> Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support (VS for Mac 7.2.2)</li>
<li> Fixed transitive types from references not being available</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.2</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-october-9-2017---visual-studio-2017-for-mac-720636">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet package fallback folders support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core SDK 2.0 defines a NuGet package fallback folder <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder</code> that can be used when looking
for NuGet packages whilst restoring. This fallback folder is now supported by
Visual Studio for Mac 7.2 so that on restoring a .NET Core 2.0 project the NuGet
packages from the fallback folder will be found and do not need to be downloaded from nuget.org into the
local machine NuGet package cache <code>~/.nuget/packages</code>. This should speed up NuGet package restore for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 projects the first time it occurs.</p>

<p>As well as the NuGet fallback folders Visual Studio for Mac will now add the following items to the generated project.assets.json
if they are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>configFilePaths</li>
<li>sources</li>
<li>warningProperties</li>
</ul>


<h2>AssetTargetFallback support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses an AssetTargetFallback MSBuild property
defined in an imported SDK MSBuild files. This is used instead
of the PackageTargetFallback property when determining if a NuGet
package is compatible. Currently the AssetTargetFallback property
is set to net461 by the .NET Core 2.0 SDK which allows .NET Core projects to use NuGet
packages that include assemblies that target the full .NET Framework.
The supported fallback frameworks are now added to the generated
project.assets.json file by Visual Studio for Mac when a .NET Core 2.0 project is restored.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore now fails if package and asset target fallbacks are defined by a project</h2>

<p>If both AssetTargetFallback and PackageTargetFallback are defined by a project then the
NuGet restore will fail with an error indicating that they cannot
be used together. This mirrors the behaviour of the .NET Core command
line restore.</p>

<h2>Mark implicit PackageReferences as auto referenced</h2>

<p>PackageReference items that have IsImplicitlyDefined set to true
in their metadata now have autoRefererenced set to true in the project.assets.json file.</p>

<h2>Support parsing MSBuild conditions with unquoted properties</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses conditions that pass properties to the
Exists function without using single quotes around the MSBuild property.
This is now supported by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="Exists($(FileName))"&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 support</h2>

<p>The following sections cover bug fixes made in Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.2
to improve support for <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/xamarin-forms/xamarin-forms-2.4/2.4.0-stable/">Xamarin.Forms 2.4</a> and later versions. Xamarin.Forms 2.4 includes .NET Standard support as well as defining default MSBuild items for
.NET Core and .NET Standard projects. These default MSBuild items were not
handled by Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.0 and earlier versions. The main symptoms of Visual Studio for Mac not supporting Xamarin.Forms 2.4 were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Duplicate .xaml files in the Solution window.</li>
<li>Nesting of .xaml and .xaml.cs files not working in Solution window.</li>
<li>MSBuild items incorrectly added to SDK style projects.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Generated NuGet files being imported twice</h3>

<p>The generated NuGet files, .nuget.g.targets and .nuget.g.props,
that are created for .NET Core projects were being imported twice.
Once by Microsoft.Common.props, that is provided with Mono, and once
by Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<p>This double import was causing a duplicate file
to be added to the
project when Xamarin.Forms 2.4
was used in a .NET Standard project and the .NET Core SDK was not
installed. This would result in the .xaml file and associated
.xaml.cs file not being nested in the solution window.</p>

<h3>MSBuild items added when new xaml file added to project</h3>

<p>Adding a new Xamarin.Forms content page with XAML would incorrectly add an
update item to the project for the .xaml.cs file when an SDK style project
was used.</p>

<p>When a new .xaml file was added to an SDK style project a None item as well as an EmbeddedResource item would incorrectly be added to the project file.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>&lt;None Remove="MyView.xaml" /&gt;
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>&lt;EmbeddedResource Include="MyView.xaml"&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  &lt;Generator&gt;MSBuild:UpdateDesignTimeXaml"&lt;/Generator&gt;
</span><span class='line'>&lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Compile item added with DependentUpon metadata</h3>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines a wildcard update similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When a project was saved in Visual Studio for Mac a Compile item was
incorrectly added to the main project with the evaluated value stored in the
DependentUpon element.</p>

<h3>DependentUpon being evaluated incorrectly</h3>

<p>Metadata defined for wildcard MSBuild items were being evaluated using
the wildcard item instead of the expanded item. This
was causing .xaml.cs files to not be nested in the Solution window
for Xamarin.Forms 2.4.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms 2.4 defines an update item similar to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Compile Update="**\*.xaml.cs" DependentUpon="%(Filename)" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The DependentUpon property was evaluated using the wildcard item
which resulted in the DependentUpon property being
evaluated as &lsquo;*.xaml.cs&rsquo; instead of the filename of the item that was
updated by the wildcard.</p>

<h3>Define MSBuildSDKsPath for MSBuild engine host</h3>

<p>MSBuild when run on the command line defines the MSBuildSDKsPath in
its MSBuild.dll.config file. The MSBuild engine host that is used
when building with Visual Studio for Mac now also defines the MSBuildSDKsPath property. Previously this was not being defined.</p>

<p>This fixes a build error when using Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 in an SDK style
project that targets .NET Standard. Xamarin.Forms 2.4.0 uses default
item imports which were not being included since they are conditionally
imported based on the MSBuildSDKsPath property value:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Import Project="$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)Xamarin.Forms.DefaultItems.props" 
    Condition="'$(MSBuildSDKsPath)'!=''" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the SDK style project had a .xaml file and a .xaml.cs file then
the .xaml.g.cs file was not being generated when the project had no files
explicitly defined in the project file. This
then caused a build error about the InitializeComponent method not
being defined.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive assembly references not available until restart</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC
references LibB which references LibA. If the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet
package was installed into LibA the types from this NuGet package
were not available in LibB or LibC until the solution was closed and
re-opened again. Closing and re-opening the solution refreshes the
reference information used by the type system. Now when a NuGet
package is installed into a .NET Core project the projects that
reference this project have their reference information refreshed. Types from
the installed NuGet packages are then available in projects that
reference this updated project either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive project references after editing a project file</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC references
LibB which references LibA. If a NuGet package is added to LibA by
editing its project file in the text editor the types from this NuGet
package were not available to LibB or LibC without restarting Visual Studio
for Mac or until the packages were restored for the solution. Now when the project file
is saved the projects that directly or indirectly reference the project
will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore project references with ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false when restoring</strong></p>

<p>Project references that have ReferenceOutputAssembly are now not
added to the project.assets.json file. This was causing
the NuGet package restore to fail in some cases. For example, if a .NET Standard
project has a project reference to a .NET Core App project, but has the
ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false, then running dotnet restore from the
command line would work, but the restore would fail in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

<li> NuGet 4.3.1 support</li>
<li> NuGet fallback folders support</li>
<li> AssetTargetFallback support</li>
<li> NuGet operations can be cancelled on closing the solution</li>
<li> Fixed transitive types from references not being available</li>
<li> Fixed credential dialog being shown multiple times on opening a solution</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.2</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-october-9-2017---visual-studio-2017-for-mac-720636">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 4.3.1 support</h2>

<p>NuGet 4.3.1.4445 is now included with Visual Studio for Mac 7.2.</p>

<p>NuGet 4.3.1 includes <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/5806">a fix for imports in the project.json file being ignored</a> which could cause a NuGet package
to incorrectly be considered incompatible when restoring NuGet packages.</p>

<h2>NuGet package fallback folders support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core SDK 2.0 defines a NuGet package fallback folder <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/NuGetFallbackFolder</code> that can be used when looking
for NuGet packages whilst restoring. This fallback folder is now supported by
Visual Studio for Mac 7.2 so that on restoring a .NET Core 2.0 project the NuGet

local machine NuGet package cache <code>~/.nuget/packages</code>. This should speed up NuGet package restore for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 projects the first time it occurs.</p>

<p>As well as the NuGet fallback folders Visual Studio for Mac will now add the following items to the generated project.assets.json
if they are available:</p>

<ul>
<li>configFilePaths</li>
<li>sources</li>
<li>warningProperties</li>
</ul>


<h2>AssetTargetFallback support</h2>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK uses an AssetTargetFallback MSBuild property
defined in an imported SDK MSBuild files. This is used instead
of the PackageTargetFallback property when determining if a NuGet
package is compatible. Currently the AssetTargetFallback property
is set to net461 by the .NET Core 2.0 SDK which allows .NET Core projects to use NuGet
packages that include assemblies that target the full .NET Framework.
The supported fallback frameworks are now added to the generated
project.assets.json file by Visual Studio for Mac when a .NET Core 2.0 project is restored.</p>

<h2>NuGet operations can be cancelled on the closing the solution</h2>

<p>Previously when closing the solution, or closing Visual Studio for Mac, when a NuGet package
operation was still running would result in a dialog being displayed saying that the
solution cannot be closed until the NuGet operation was completed.
NuGet v3 and above now allow the NuGet
operations to be cancelled so now the dialog allows the current
operation to be cancelled. If the
operation is taking a while to cancel a busy spinner image will be displayed in
the dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-2/CancelNuGetOperationOnClosingSolutionDialog.png" title="Cancel NuGet operation dialog on closing solution" alt="Cancel NuGet operation dialog on closing solution"></p>

<p>If a restore is being run when the solution
will be closed the restore will be cancelled automatically without showing the dialog.</p>

<h2>NuGet package restore now fails if package and asset target fallbacks are defined by a project</h2>

<p>If both AssetTargetFallback and PackageTargetFallback are defined by a project then the
NuGet restore will fail with an error indicating that they cannot
be used together. This mirrors the behaviour of the .NET Core command
line restore.</p>

<h2>Support imported package references in non .NET Core projects</h2>

<p>If a non .NET Core project had no PackageReference items but imported a file that
did have PackageReference items the NuGet packages were not restored
on opening the solution. This was because only the PackageReference
items defined directly in the project were checked to determine if the
project used NuGet packages. Now the evaluated MSBuild items are checked
so any imported PackageReference items are detected and a restore
will be run on opening the solution.</p>

<p>Note that imported PackageReference items are not displayed in the
Packages folder.</p>

<h2>Package Console is no longer opened when a NuGet operation is cancelled</h2>

<p>When a NuGet operation is cancelled from the main status bar the
Package Console is now not opened when the NuGet operation fails due
to the cancellation. If the NuGet operation is not cancelled then the
Package Console window will still be opened as before if the operation fails.
This is also a workaround for Visual Studio for Mac closing the currently displayed
dialog when the Package Console window opens after the NuGet operation
is cancelled when closing the solution.</p>

<h2>Whitespace is now trimmed when creating a new package source</h2>

<p>When creating a new package source copying and pasting NuGet package source url can sometimes copy extra
whitespace which can then result in NuGet package restore errors such as:</p>

<pre><code>Failed to verify the root directory of local source
' https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json'.
</code></pre>

<p>The package source name and url will now have whitespace trimmed to avoid
this copy and paste problem. This also
matches Visual Studio on Windows behaviour.</p>

<h2>Mark implicit PackageReferences as auto referenced</h2>

<p>PackageReference items that have IsImplicitlyDefined set to true
in their metadata now have autoRefererenced set to true in the project.assets.json file.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive assembly references not available until restart</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC
references LibB which references LibA. If the Newtonsoft.Json NuGet
package was installed into LibA the types from this NuGet package
were not available in LibB or LibC until the solution was closed and
re-opened again. Closing and re-opening the solution refreshes the
reference information used by the type system. Now when a NuGet
package is installed into a .NET Core project the projects that
reference this project have their reference information refreshed. Types from
the installed NuGet packages are then available in projects that
reference this updated project either directly or indirectly.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed transitive project references after editing a project file</strong></p>

<p>Given a solution that contains three .NET Standard projects: LibC references
LibB which references LibA. If a NuGet package is added to LibA by
editing its project file in the text editor the types from this NuGet
package were not available to LibB or LibC without restarting Visual Studio
for Mac or until the packages were restored for the solution. Now when the project file
is saved the projects that directly or indirectly reference the project
will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed credential dialog shown multiple times on opening a solution</strong></p>

<p>With check for updates enabled, multiple projects in the solution,
and a package source that was missing or had invalid credentials,
on opening the solution the credential dialog would be displayed multiple
times even if the correct username and password was entered or the
dialog was cancelled. The dialog was being displayed for each
project and the credential information was not being re-used.</p>

<p>Now the NuGet source repositories are re-used when checking
for updates and also when restoring the projects when the solution
is first opened. Any valid credentials entered will be re-used
when checking the remaining projects. If the credential dialog is
cancelled then the dialog is no longer displayed again whilst
checking for updates for the other projects.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed credential dialog displayed when credentials are available</strong></p>

<p>With valid credentials stored in the Mac key chain the credential dialog would
still be displayed when it should not have been. The problem was that the
NuGet credential service puts itself in a retry mode if any of the
credential providers are used when trying to authenticate against a
package source. Once in this retry mode the Visual Studio for Mac credential
provider would always show a dialog asking for the credentials instead
of re-using the existing credentials. To avoid this the credential
service is reset before any user actions, such as opening the Add Packages
dialog, running a restore or an update.</p>

<p><strong>Fixed crash when displaying Chinese characters in the Add Packages dialog</strong></p>

<p>With the NuGet v3 package source <a href="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json">https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json</a>
selected, searching for Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client would result in
the Visual Studio for Mac terminating when an attempt was made to display the results
in the Add Packages dialog.
The crash was in the Pango library when it attempted to determine the size of
the package title displayed in the search results. If the package
title contained Chinese characters then Pango would throw an exception:</p>

<pre><code>Illegal byte sequence encounted in the input.
at (wrapper managed-to-native) Pango.Layout:pango_layout_get_pixel_size (intptr,int&amp;,int&amp;)
</code></pre>

<p>Then when Visual Studio for Mac tried to use Pango again to determine the
size of the text this would result in Visual Studio for Mac terminating.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Pango-WARNING (recursed) **: shaping failure, expect ugly output.
</span><span class='line'>shape-engine='BasicEngineCoreText', font='.SF NS Text',
</span><span class='line'>text='∫ê'Stacktrace:
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  at &lt;unknown&gt; &lt;0xffffffff&gt;
</span><span class='line'>  at (wrapper managed-to-native) Pango.Layout.pango_layout_get_pixel_size (intptr,int&,int&) [0x0000b] in &lt;c7aa2d93df4045df8dc71d5439f99d72&gt;:0</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If the NuGet v2 package source was used then this crash did not occur
since the package title was not returned in the search results and the package id would be
displayed instead which does not contain Chinese characters.</p>

<p>As a workaround the Add Packages dialog now displays the package id
instead of the package title.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore project references with ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false when restoring</strong></p>

<p>Project references that have ReferenceOutputAssembly are now not
added to the project.assets.json file. This was causing
the NuGet package restore to fail in some cases. For example, if a .NET Standard
project has a project reference to a .NET Core App project, but has the
ReferenceOutputAssembly set to false, then running dotnet restore from the
command line would work, but the restore would fail in Visual Studio for Mac.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> NuGet 4.3 support</li>
<li> Support PackageReference in non .NET Core projects</li>
<li> Enable file template when a NuGet package is installed</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.1</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-august-14-2017---visual-studio-for-mac-7101297">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 4.3 Support</h2>

<p>NuGet 4.3.0.2418 is now included with Visual Studio for Mac 7.1.</p>

<p>This version of NuGet adds support for .NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0
target frameworks.</p>

<h2>Support PackageReference in non .NET Core projects</h2>

<p>Non .NET Core Sdk style projects that use a PackageReference MSBuild item are now supported.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json"&gt;
  &lt;Version&gt;10.0.1&lt;/Version&gt;
&lt;/PackageReference&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In Visual Studio for Mac 7.0 the Solution
window would not show any packages for the project, would not allow
the packages to be restored, and would create a packages.config file when installing
a NuGet package even though the project was using PackageReferences.</p>

<p>Now if the project has a PackageReference the Packages folder
shows the installed packages and can be used to update or install
NuGet packages which will also create PackageReference MSBuild items.</p>

<p>If the project has no PackageReferences then by default a
packages.config file will be created when a NuGet package is installed.</p>

<p>Currently it is not possible to opt-in to using PackageReferences by default.
So the project file will need to be edited in the text editor to include at
least one PackageReference before the default behaviour of using a packages.config
file is overridden.</p>

<h2>Enable file template when a NuGet package is installed</h2>

<p>A file template can now specify that it should be enabled if the project
has a specific reference or has a specific NuGet package installed.
Previously it was only possible to enable a file template based on the
references defined in the project file.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;HasPackageOrReference PackageId="Xamarin.Forms" Assembly="Xamarin.Forms" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Whilst a reference will work for projects that use a packages.config
file, if the project uses a project.json file or PackageReferences
then checking the references defined in the project would not find any matches and
the file template would not be enabled.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Do not require description when creating a new NuGet package project</strong></p>

<p>When creating a NuGet package project or a multiplatform project the description
needed to be specified in the New Project dialog.</p>

<p>To simplify the project creation
process the package id is used as the description by default. As you type the
package id into the New Project dialog the description text
box will be updated. The description can be changed to be different
to the package id if required.</p>

<p><strong>Fix being unable to load NuGet Package Project created by Visual Studio on Windows</strong></p>

<p>Visual Studio on Windows creates a NuGet package project (.nuproj)
with no target framework version which resulted in 4.0 being used by
default in Visual Studio for Mac. This would cause the project to fail to
load in Visual Studio for Mac since it was checking for 4.5 or later.</p>

<p><strong>Fix no packages shown in Packages folder for NuGet Package Projects</strong></p>

<p>Opening a previously created NuGet package project (.nuproj) would show no
packages in the Packages folder.</p>

<p>The problem was that the PackageReference project item was defined by
both the NuGet addin and the Packaging addin. The NuGet addin&rsquo;s PackageReference
project item was used instead of the one defined by the Packaging addin so no
package references were found for the NuGet package project.</p>

<p><strong>Fix NuGet Package Project&rsquo;s MSBuild targets not being created</strong></p>

<p>If the NuGet package project&rsquo;s generated .nuget.targets or .nuget.props are missing
then these are now created on opening the solution if
automatic restore is enabled.</p>

<p><strong>Fix being unable to package .NET Standard projects</strong></p>

<p>A NuGet package project that referenced an Sdk style .NET Standard project
would fail to build the NuGet package. The build would fail with an error:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Project targets '.NETStandard,Version=v1.4'. It cannot be
referenced by a project that targets 'NuGet,Version=v1.0'
</code></pre>

<p>Updating to a more recent NuGet.Build.Packaging NuGet
package, such as version 0.1.276, fixes this problem.</p>

<p><strong>NuGet Package project treated as .NET Core project</strong></p>

<p>NuGet package projects (.nuproj) that use the NuGet.Build.Packaging
0.1.276 NuGet package define a TargetFramework property in an
imported MSBuild .props file. This was causing the project to
be treated as a .NET Core project by Visual Studio for Mac. This caused
the Dependencies folder to be displayed and the References folder
to be removed. Visual Studio for Mac now checks the project has the
Sdk attribute instead of looking at the MSBuild properties defined
by the project when determining the project type.</p>

<li> .NET Core 2.0 support</li>
<li> Target framework selection for new projects</li>
<li> New project templates</li>
<li> .NET Core Runtimes and SDKs displayed in About Dialog</li>
<li> Improved support for multi target framework projects</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.1</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes#release-date-august-14-2017---visual-studio-for-mac-7101297">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>.NET Core 2.0 Support</h2>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac 7.1 adds support for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/">.NET Core 2.0</a> and .NET Standard 2.0.</p>

<p>The .NET Core 2.0 SDK needs to be <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core">installed</a> separately.</p>

<h2>Target Framework Selection for New Projects</h2>

<p>If a project template supports multiple target frameworks, and the corresponding framework is available, then the New Project dialog will allow the framework to be selected before the project is created.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/DotNetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-1/NewNetCoreProjectTargetFrameworkSelection.png" title="New .NET Core target framework selection" alt="New .NET Core target framework selection"></p>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac includes project templates for .NET Core 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0 as well as for .NET Standard versions 1.0 through to 2.0.</p>

<p>To be able to create projects that target .NET Core 2.0 or .NET Standard 2.0 the .NET Core 2.0 SDK needs to be installed.</p>

<h2>New Project Templates</h2>

<p>The following project templates have been added:</p>

<ul>
<li>ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)

<ul>
<li>Available if .NET Core 2.0 SDK is installed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Class Library

<ul>
<li>Targets .NET Core instead of .NET Standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSTest</li>
</ul>


<p>Some project templates do not support all the target framework versions.
For example, the ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages) only supports
.NET Core 2.0, so this template will only be displayed if .NET Core 2.0 SDK
is installed.</p>

<p>The F# project templates have some restrictions on what target frameworks
they support. The F# .NET Standard project templates do not
support selecting .NET Standard versions below 1.6. The F# Class Library project
only supports .NET Core 2.0.</p>

<h2>.NET Core Runtime and SDKs displayed in About Dialog</h2>

<p>The About dialog will now display the .NET Core runtimes and SDKs that are installed on
the local machine.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/DotNetCoreSupportInVisualStudioMac7-1/NetCoreInformationAboutDialog.png" title=".NET Core runtime and SDK information in About dialog" alt=".NET Core runtime and SDK information in About dialog"></p>

<h2>Improved Support for Multi Target Framework Projects</h2>

<p>SDK style projects that target multiple frameworks can now be opened in Visual Studio for
Mac 7.1 and will show source files as well as NuGet package dependencies.</p>

<p>The project will be treated as though it only has
one target framework which is the first one specified in the
TargetFrameworks property in the project file.</p>

<p>Please note that currently the support for multiple target frameworks is limited in
comparison with Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>ASP.NET Core Web API project does not open API url on launching browser</strong></p>

<p>When an ASP.NET Core Web API project was run it would open a blank web
page in the browser instead of a page that showed the api values. Now when a new ASP.NET
Core Web API project is run the <code>http://localhost:&lt;port&gt;/api/values</code> url is launched in
the browser so the API values will be displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Unable to run or debug ASP.NET Core project with empty SDK directory</strong></p>

<p>If there was an empty directory inside the .NET Core SDK directory <code>/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk</code> then it was
not possible to run or debug an ASP.NET Core web project</p>

<p>If the .NET Core SDK MSBuild files were not found in the SDK directory then the
project&rsquo;s OutputType was not read and would result in the project being treated
as a library project. This could also occur if only
the .NET Core runtime is installed.</p>

<p><strong>Shared project files shown for .NET Core project in Solution window</strong></p>

<p>When a .NET Core project referenced a shared assets project the files
from the shared project were incorrectly being displayed in the .NET Core project in
the Solution window.</p>

<p><strong>Fix generated code for resource files in .NET Core projects</strong></p>

<p>Adding a resx file to a .NET Core 1.x or .NET Standard 1.x project would result in
code being generated that could not be compiled.</p>

<p>Projects that target .NET Core App 1.0, 1.1, or .NET Standard below version 2.0
cannot compile code that uses <code>typeof(Resources).Assembly</code> which was
being generated by the ResXFileCodeGenerator. If these target frameworks
are used by the project then the code generated by Visual Studio for Mac
will now use <code>typeof(Resources).GetTypeInfo().Assembly</code> which is supported.</p>

<p>.NET Core 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.0 do not need to use GetTypeInfo so the
code generated for these frameworks has not been changed.</p>

<p><strong>Fix new resource file not added as Update item in Sdk projects</strong></p>

<p>Adding a new resource file to a .NET Core project would add the
.resx file and the .Designer.cs file as Include items instead of an
Update items.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;EmbeddedResource Include="Resources.resx"&gt;
    &lt;Generator&gt;ResXFileCodeGenerator&lt;/Generator&gt;
    &lt;LastGenOutput&gt;Resources.Designer.cs&lt;/LastGenOutput&gt;
  &lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
  &lt;Compile Include="Resources.Designer.cs"&gt;
    &lt;DependentUpon&gt;Resources.resx&lt;/DependentUpon&gt;
  &lt;/Compile&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This then caused the build to fail since these files are already included by
the .NET Core SDK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Visual Studio on Windows can be <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hy2sthf1.aspx">configured to use a different editor to open a file</a>. With Visual Studio for Mac, whilst you can open a file with a selection of editors and applications, it is not currently possible to change the default editor or add a custom application.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-open-with-addin">Open With addin</a> provides an Open With dialog that allows you to change the default editor or application used to open a file in a similar way to how this is done in Visual Studio on Windows.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Supports changing the default editor used to open a file.</li>
<li>Supports adding a custom application to open a file.</li>
<li>Editor configuration is saved and will be available on restarting Visual Studio for Mac.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Supports</h2>

<ul>
<li>Visual Studio Mac 7.0 or later.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Configuring the Default Editor or Application</h2>

<p>To configure the application or editor used to open file you can right click the file in the Solution window and select Open With &ndash; Preferences&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/ConfiguringOpenWithInVisualStudioMac7-0/OpenWithPreferencesMenu.png" title="Open With - Preferences context menu" alt="Open With - Preferences context menu"></p>

<p>This will open the Open With dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/ConfiguringOpenWithInVisualStudioMac7-0/OpenWithDialog.png" title="Open With dialog" alt="Open With dialog"></p>

<p>The editors and applications that support opening the file are displayed. The default application is indicated by having (Default) next to its name.</p>

<p>To change the default application or editor used to open the file select it and then click the Set as Default button. Click OK to close the dialog and save the configuration.</p>

<p>If a file is currently open then it will need to be closed before it is opened in the new default editor or application.</p>

<h2>Adding a Custom Application</h2>

<p>A custom application can be added to the list of applications shown in the Open With menu. First open the Open With dialog by selecting Open With &ndash; Preferences. Then click the Add button to open the Add Application dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/ConfiguringOpenWithInVisualStudioMac7-0/AddApplicationDialog.png" title="Add Application dialog" alt="Add Application dialog"></p>

<p>The Browse button can be used to find an application.</p>

<p>The Friendly Name is the name that will be displayed in the Open With menu for the custom application.</p>

<p>Arguments cannot be specified if a Mac application (.app) is used. However if the application is not a Mac application, for example, it is a C# program, then arguments can be passed. To pass the filename to the program you can use {0} in the Arguments text box. This placeholder will be expanded to be the full filename path when the program is run.</p>

<h2>Removing a Custom Application</h2>

<p>To remove a custom application for a file first open the Open With dialog by selecting Open With &ndash; Preferences. Select the application you want to remove. Then click the Remove button.</p>

<p>The Remove button is only enabled for custom applications that you have added. The built-in editors and applications cannot be removed.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The Open With addin is available to download from <a href="https://github.com/mrward/monodevelop-open-with-addin/releases/download/0.1/MonoDevelop.OpenWith_0.1.mpack">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>To install the addin open the Extensions Manager by selecting Extensions&hellip; from the main menu. Click the Install from file button. Select the .mpack file and then click the Open button.</p>

<p>The addin is also in the Extensions Manager from the
<a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/Project/Index/306">Visual Studio Extension Repository (Beta channel)</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>New Features</h2>

<ul>
<li> .NET Core support</li>
<li> NuGet 4.0 support</li>
</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/">Visual Studio for Mac 7.0</a> can be found in the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2017-mac-relnotes">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>.NET Core Support</h2>

<p>.NET Core projects do not show a Packages folder in the Solution window. Instead the NuGet packages are displayed in a NuGet folder, which is inside a Dependencies folder.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-0/NetCoreProjectJsonNetPackageInSolutionWindow.png" title="Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package in Solution window - .NET Core project" alt="Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package in Solution window - .NET Core project"></p>

<p>The version of the NuGet package is displayed directly in the Solution window. For other project types you need to right click the package to see the version.</p>

<p>If the NuGet package depends on other packages then these can be seen by clicking on the arrow to expand the dependencies.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-0/NetCoreProjectJsonNetPackageExpandedInSolutionWindow.png" title="Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package expanded in Solution window - .NET Core project" alt="Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package expanded in Solution window - .NET Core project"></p>

<h3>Restoring Packages</h3>

<p>NuGet packages will be restored automatically on opening a .NET Core project. This can be disabled in preferences by unchecking <strong>Automatically restore packages when opening a solution</strong> in the NuGet &ndash; General section.</p>

<p>You can manually restore NuGet packages for .NET Core projects by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right clicking the Dependencies folder and selecting Restore.</li>
<li>Right clicking the NuGet folder and selecting Restore.</li>
<li>Selecting Restore NuGet Packages from the Project menu.</li>
</ul>


<p>Selecting Restore NuGet Packages from the Project menu will restore packages for the project or the solution depending on what is currently selected in the Solution window.</p>

<p>Restoring NuGet packages for a .NET Core project works differently compared with a project that uses a packages.config file. The NuGet packages themselves will be downloaded into the NuGet package cache folder ~/.nuget/packages if they do not exist, as before, but the NuGet packages will not be copied into a packages directory inside the solution&rsquo;s directory. The project file will not contain have any Reference items added when a NuGet package is installed.</p>

<p>When a NuGet restore is run for a .NET Core project three files in the obj directory are created.</p>

<ul>
<li>project.assets.json</li>
<li>ProjectName.csproj.nuget.g.props</li>
<li>ProjectName.csproj.nuget.g.targets</li>
</ul>


<p>The project.assets.json file contains the dependencies for your project.</p>

<p>The nuget.g.props and nuget.g.targets files will contain any MSBuild imports that your NuGet package requires and they also define some properties, such as the path to the NuGet package cache on your machine.</p>

<p>These three files are used when building your project to resolve the assemblies to be referenced now that they are no longer explicitly stored in your project file.</p>

<h3>Updating Packages</h3>

<p>NuGet packages can be updated by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right clicking the package inside the NuGet folder and selecting Update.</li>
<li>Right clicking the NuGet folder and selecting Update.</li>
<li>Right clicking the Dependencies folder and selecting Update.</li>
<li>Selecting Update NuGet Packages from the Project menu.</li>
</ul>


<p>Selecting Update NuGet Packages from the Project menu will update all packages in the project or in the solution depending on what is currently selected in the Solution window.</p>

<h3>Removing Multiple NuGet Packages in One Step</h3>

<p>You can remove multiple NuGet packages in one step from a .NET Core project by selecting the packages in the Solution window, right clicking and selecting Remove.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInVisualStudioMac7-0/NetCoreProjectRemoveMultipleNuGetPackagesInSolutionWindow.png" title="Removing multiple NuGet packages in Solution window - .NET Core project" alt="Removing multiple NuGet packages in Solution window - .NET Core project"></p>

<p>Projects that use a packages.config file do not support removing multiple NuGet packages in one step.</p>

<h3>Installing NuGet Packages</h3>

<p>NuGet packages are installed by using the Add Packages dialog in the same way as with other project types. To open the Add Packages dialog for a .NET Core project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right click the NuGet folder and select Add Packages&hellip;</li>
<li>Right click the Dependencies folder and select Add Packages&hellip;</li>
<li>Right click the project and select Add &ndash; Add NuGet Packages&hellip;</li>
<li>From the Project menu select Add NuGet Packages&hellip;</li>
</ul>


<p>When the first NuGet package is installed into a .NET Core project a packages.config file will not be created. Instead the NuGet package will be added as a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files">PackageReference</a> that is saved in the project file.</p>

<h3>Package Reference</h3>

<p>.NET Core projects do not use a packages.config file to record their NuGet dependencies. Instead the .NET Core project file will contain a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-references-in-project-files">PackageReference</a> after the NuGet package is installed into the project.</p>

<p>Please note that Visual Studio for Mac currently only supports package references with the new SDK style projects which are used by .NET Core. If you use package references in other project types then the Solution window will not show the packages and a packages.config file will be created if you install a NuGet package.</p>

<h3>Updated Packages Available</h3>

<p>For other project types the Solution window will check for updated packages and show this information in the Packages folder. This is not currently supported with .NET Core projects.</p>

<h2>NuGet 4.0 Support</h2>

<p>Visual Studio for Mac now includes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-4.0-rtm">NuGet 4.0</a>.</p>

<p>More information on the new features provided by NuGet 4.&ndash; can be found in the <a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20170308/Announcing-NuGet-4.0-RTM.html">Announcing NuGet 4.0 RTM blog post</a> and the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-4.0-rtm">NuGet 4.0 release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGetizer 3000</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/nuget/nuget.build.packaging">NuGetizer 3000</a> is a set of build tools for creating NuGet packages inspired by <a href="http://nuproj.net/">NuProj</a>. Support for NuGetizer 3000 in Xamarin Studio includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project templates for creating NuGet packages</li>
<li>Support for creating a NuGet package from an existing project</li>
<li>Reference assembly generation for Portable Class Library profiles</li>
</ul>


<p>The following sections look at the NuGetizer 3000 features provided by Xamarin Studio. For more detailed information on what is supported by NuGetizer 3000 please read the <a href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/wiki/NuGetizer-3000">NuGetizer 3000 feature spec</a>.</p>

<h3>Project Templates</h3>

<p>There are two new project templates available.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multiplatform Library</li>
<li>NuGet package</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/MultiplatformLibraryNewProjectDialog.png" title="Mulitplatform Library project template in New Project dialog" alt="Mulitplatform Library project template in New Project dialog"></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/NuGetPackageNewProjectDialog.png" title="NuGet Package project template in New Project dialog" alt="NuGet Package project template in New Project dialog"></p>

<h3>Multiplatform Library &ndash; Single for all platforms</h3>

<p>The Mulitplatform Library project template will create a Portable Class Library project with NuGet package metadata when the Single for all platforms option is selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/MultiplatformLibraryWizardSingleSelected.png" title="Multiplatform library - single for all platforms selected" alt="Multiplatform library - single for all platforms selected"></p>

<p>To create a NuGet package right click the project and select Create NuGet Package. This will generate a NuGet package (.nupkg) in the output directory with the Portable Class Library assembly in the corresponding portable lib directory inside the NuGet package.</p>

<h3>Multiplatform Library &ndash; Platform specific</h3>

<p>This Multiplatform Library will create a shared project, an iOS project, an Android project and a NuGet packaging project when the iOS and Android options are selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/MultiplatformLibraryWizardPlatformsSelected.png" title="Multiplatform library - iOS and Android selected" alt="Multiplatform library - iOS and Android selected"></p>

<p>The iOS and Android project will reference the shared project. The NuGet packaging project will reference the iOS and Android projects. The NuGet packaging project will contain the NuGet package metadata.</p>

<p>When the NuGet packaging project is built it will create the NuGet package in its output folder and inside the NuGet package will be the Android and iOS output assemblies each in their own platform specific lib folders.</p>

<h3>NuGet Packaging Project</h3>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/NuGetPackageWizard.png" title="NuGet package project template configuration" alt="NuGet package project template configuration"></p>

<p>The NuGet packaging project can be used to create a meta NuGet package, which is a NuGet package that has no content itself but references other NuGet packages, or it can reference other projects and it will add their output assemblies to the NuGet package. If the referenced project has NuGet package references then these will be added to the generated NuGet package as dependencies.</p>

<p>NuGet packages can be added to the NuGet packaging project by using the Add Packages dialog.</p>

<p>To include files in the NuGet packaging project the files need to have Include in Package property set to true. This can be done by right clicking the file in the solution window, selecting Properties, then selecting Include in Package from the NuGet section in the Properties window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/IncludeInPackagePropertiesWindow.png" title="Include in Package in Properties window" alt="Include in Package in Properties window"></p>

<h3>Adding NuGet Package Metadata</h3>

<p>NuGet package metadata can be added to any .NET project by selecting the NuGet Package &ndash; Metadata page available in the project options.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/NuGetPackageMetadataProjectOptions.png" title="NuGet Package metadata in project options" alt="NuGet package metadata in project options"></p>

<p>The General tab shows compulsory metadata that must be specified for a NuGet package. The Details tab shows other optional metadata that can be specified. This NuGet package metadata is saved directly into the project file (.csproj).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/NuGetPackageMetadataDetailsProjectOptions.png" title="NuGet Package metadata in project options" alt="NuGet package metadata in project options"></p>

<p>Once NuGet package metadata has been added then the NuGet.Build.Packaging NuGet package will be added to the project if it does not already exist. This NuGet package provides MSBuild tasks that are used when creating the NuGet package for the project.</p>

<p>NuGet package metadata should be added to project if you want to be able to create a NuGet package for that project on its own. Without NuGet package metadata the project would need to be referenced by a NuGet packaging project, or another project with NuGet package metadata, for it to be included in a NuGet package.</p>

<p>If a NuGet packaging project references a project that has its own NuGet package metadata then a dependency will be added to the NuGet package created by the NuGet packaging project. The referenced project&rsquo;s output assembly would not be included in the NuGet package created by the packaging project in this case.</p>

<h3>Generating a NuGet Package</h3>

<p>To generate a NuGet package you can right click the project and select Create NuGet Package.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/CreateNuGetPackageMenuItem.png" title="Create NuGet Package menu item" alt="Create NuGet Package menu item"></p>

<p>For NuGet packaging projects you can also build the project and it will create a NuGet package.</p>

<p>For a .NET project that has NuGet package metadata you can generate a NuGet package when building the project by enabling the &ldquo;Create a NuGet Package when building the project&rdquo; option in the Project Options dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/CreateNuGetPackageWhenBuildingOption.png" title="Creating a NuGet Package when building the project option - project options" alt="Creating a NuGet Package when building the project - project options"></p>

<h3>Adding Platform Implementations</h3>

<p>If you have a Portable Class Library with NuGet package metadata you can add platform specific implementations for iOS and Android by right clicking the project and selecting Add &ndash; Add Platform Implementation. This will open a dialog where you can choose iOS and Android, and also whether to create a shared project.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/AddPlatformImplementationDialog.png" title="Add Platform Implementation dialog" alt="Add Platform Implementation dialog"></p>

<p>After clicking OK an Android and iOS project will be created along with a NuGet packaging project that references these projects. The NuGet package metadata will be moved from the Portable Class Library project to the NuGet packaging project. If the shared project option was selected then the code from the Portable Class Library project will be moved to the shared project. The shared project will be referenced by the iOS and Android project.</p>

<h3>Reference Assembly Generation</h3>

<p>In the Project Options for a NuGet Packaging project there is a Reference Assemblies page in the NuGet Package category. This pages shows a list of Portable Class Library profiles that can be selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/ReferenceAssembliesProjectOptions.png" title="Reference assemblies in project options" alt="Reference assemblies in project options"></p>

<p>Reference assemblies for the selected profiles will be generated based on the output assemblies from the projects referenced by the NuGet packaging project.</p>

<p>That brings us to the end of the walkthrough of the NuGetizer 3000 features provided by Xamarin Studio.</p>

<h2>NuGet 3.5 Support</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio now includes <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/release-notes/nuget-3.5-rtm">NuGet 3.5</a>.</p>

<p>More information on the new features provided by NuGet 3.5 can be found in the <a href="http://blog.nuget.org/20161027/Announcing-NuGet-3.5-RTM.html">Announcing NuGet 3.5 RTM blog post</a> and the <a href="http://docs.nuget.org/ndocs/release-notes/nuget-3.5-RTM">NuGet 3.5 release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>Improved project.json Support</h2>

<p>NuGet packages are now automatically restored when the project.json file is saved in the text editor.</p>

<h2>Native License Acceptance Dialog</h2>

<p>The Licence Acceptance dialog now uses native UI.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-2/LicenseAcceptanceDialog.png" title="License Acceptance dialog" alt="License Acceptance dialog"></p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Updating all NuGet packages installs unexpected pre-release NuGet packages</strong></p>

<p>With a pre-release NuGet package installed in a project, updating
all the NuGet packages in the project could cause the stable NuGet
packages to be updated to pre-release versions. On updating all the packages if any were pre-release the include
pre-release flag would be set on updating which would allow any
pre-release NuGet packages to be used on updating. Now the include pre-release flag is not set on updating. NuGet 3
will still update pre-release NuGet packages to the latest pre-release
or latest stable, depending on which is the latest version, without
this include pre-release flag being set. NuGet 2 required the include
pre-release flag set to update a pre-release to the latest pre-release.</p>

<p>An example &ndash; project has the following NuGet packages
installed:</p>

<pre><code>Xamarin.Forms 2.3.3.180
Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView 2.3.0-pre1
</code></pre>

<p>Latest available packages from nuget.org:</p>

<pre><code>Xamarin.Forms 2.3.3.180 (latest stable)
Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4.184-pre1 (latest pre-release)
Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView 2.3.0-pre2
</code></pre>

<p>Expected result on updating all packages in the project:</p>

<pre><code>Xamarin.Forms 2.3.3.180
Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView 2.3.0-pre2
</code></pre>

<p>Actual result:</p>

<pre><code>Xamarin.Forms 2.3.4.184-pre1
Xamarin.Forms.CarouselView 2.3.0-pre2
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Types unavailable when NuGet package added to project.json file</strong></p>

<p>When a NuGet package was added to a project that used a project.json file
the types from the assembly provided by the NuGet package were not
available until the project was reloaded or the references were
modified. This prevented code completion from showing the correct information.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellCommandTooltip.png" title="PowerShell command tooltip on hover" alt="PowerShell command tooltip on hover"></p>

<h2>Syntax Errors</h2>

<p>Syntax errors are highlighted in the text editor. Hovering the mouse over the highlighted error will show information about the error.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellSyntaxError.png" title="PowerShell syntax error highlighting" alt="PowerShell syntax error highlighting"></p>

<h2>Find references</h2>

<p>To find references of a variable or a method you can right click in the text editor and select Find References.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellFindReferencesContextMenu.png" title="PowerShell find references text editor context menu" alt="PowerShell find references text editor context menu"></p>

<p>The references found are then displayed in the Search Results window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellFindReferencesSearchResults.png" title="PowerShell find references text editor context menu" alt="PowerShell find references text editor context menu"></p>

<h2>Rename</h2>

<p>A variable or method can be renamed in the text editor by right clicking and selecting Rename.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellRenameContextMenu.png" title="PowerShell rename text editor context menu" alt="PowerShell rename text editor context menu"></p>

<p>On typing the new name and the text will be replaced.</p>

<h2>Show API Documentation</h2>

<p>Right clicking on a PowerShell command and selecting Show API Documentation will open the online help for that PowerShell command, if it is available, in the web browser.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellAPIDocumentationContextMenu.png" title="API Documentation text editor context menu" alt="API Documentation text editor context menu"></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellAPIOnlineDocumentation.png" title="PowerShell API documentation web page" alt="PowerShell API documentation web page"></p>

<h2>Creating a new PowerShell Script</h2>

<p>To create a new PowerShell script there is an empty PowerShell file template available from the New File dialog.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellFileTemplateInNewFileDialog.png" title="PowerShell script file template in New File dialog" alt="PowerShell script file template in New File dialog"></p>

<p>After creating a new PowerShell file it must be saved before it can be run or debugged.</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>To debug the currently active PowerShell file open in the text editor,
set a breakpoint on a line by clicking in the left hand margin, then select Start Debugging from the Run menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/RunStartDebuggingMenu.png" title="Run - Start Debugging menu" alt="Run - Start Debugging menu"></p>

<p>Alternatively you can click the Run button in the main toolbar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/DebugRunMainToolbarButton.png" title="Run button in the main toolbar" alt="Run button in the main toolbar"></p>

<p>A solution does not need to be open in order for a PowerShell script to be run with the debugger. You can open just a PowerShell script into Xamarin Studio and then run the debugger.</p>

<p>Once the debugger has started you can select Step Over, Step In, Step Out or Continue Debugging from the Run menu by clicking one of the main toolbar buttons.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/RunStepMenuItems.png" title="Run menu with Step menu items" alt="Run menu with Step menu items"></p>

<p>Hovering the mouse over a variable will open a tooltip showing the variable value.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/DebugTooltipOnHover.png" title="Debug tooltip on hover" alt="Debug tooltip on hover"></p>

<h2>Breakpoints</h2>

<p>Breakpoint conditions should use PowerShell syntax and not C# syntax. The Edit Breakpoint dialog says to use a C# boolean expression which is incorrect.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/EditBreakpointDialog.png" title="PowerShell breakpoint condition in Edit Breakpoint dialog" alt="PowerShell breakpoint condition in Edit Breakpoint dialog"></p>

<p>Hit conditions are only partially supported. The PowerShell Editor Services debugger supports the &lsquo;When hit count is equal to&rsquo;. Due to this restriction the other hit count options may not work as expected.</p>

<p>Printing a message and continuing is not currently supported.</p>

<p>Breaking when the value of an expression changes is not currently supported.</p>

<p>Function and exception breakpoints are not currently supported.</p>

<h2>Locals Window</h2>

<p>When debugging the Locals window will show the values of variables grouped by each PowerShell scope &ndash; Auto, Local, Script and Global.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/LocalsWindow.png" title="Locals Window" alt="Locals Window"></p>

<h2>Watch Window</h2>

<p>Variables and expressions can be entered in the Watch Window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/WatchWindow.png" title="Watch window" alt="Watch window"></p>

<p>Please note that entering a PowerShell command with missing parameters will cause the debugger to stop working. The PowerShell file will need to be closed and re-opened before the debugger will work again.</p>

<h2>Immediate Window</h2>

<p>Expressions and variables can be entered in the immediate window to get or set values.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/ImmediateWindow.png" title="Immediate window" alt="Immediate window"></p>

<p>As with the Watch Window, entering a PowerShell command with missing parameters will cause the debugger to stop working.</p>

<h1>Passing Arguments when Debugging</h1>

<p>To pass arguments when debugging a PowerShell script you can select Debug PowerShell Script&hellip; from the Run menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/DebugPowerShellScriptMenu.png" title="Run - Debug PowerShell Script menu" alt="Run - Debug PowerShell Script menu"></p>

<p>This will open a Debug PowerShell Script dialog where arguments can be specified. These arguments will be passed to the PowerShell script being run with the debugger. The settings used in this dialog will be remembered for the active text editor whilst it is open in Xamarin Studio.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/DebugPowerShellScriptDialog.png" title="Debug PowerShell Script dialog" alt="Debug PowerShell Script dialog"></p>

<h2>Launch Configuration Support</h2>

<p>In Visual Studio Code a launch.json file can be used to store launch configurations. These are supported in by the PowerShell addin in Xamarin Studio. The PowerShell addin will look for a launch.json file in the directory where the PowerShell file exists or in a .vscode subdirectory.</p>

<p>The launch configurations are shown under Active Configurations in the Run menu. Only PowerShell launch configurations which have a request type of &ldquo;launch&rdquo; are supported.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellLaunchConfigurations.png" title="PowerShell launch configurations in Run menu" alt="PowerShell launch configurations in Run menu"></p>

<p>The currently selected launch configuration will be used when debugging or running the PowerShell script. By default no launch configuration will be selected.</p>

<h2>Running without the Debugger</h2>

<p>To run the PowerShell file with PowerShell directly, instead of using the debugger, select Start without Debugging from the Run menu.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/RunStartWithoutDebuggingMenu.png" title="Run - Start without Debugging menu" alt="Run - Start without Debugging menu"></p>

<p>Output from the PowerShell script will be displayed in the Application Output window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/PowerShellScriptApplicationOutput.png" title="PowerShell script Application Output window" alt="PowerShell script Application Output window"></p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>The PowerShell addin is available from the <a href="http://addins.monodevelop.com/">MonoDevelop addin repository</a> on the beta channel. To install the addin open the Add-in Manager, search for the PowerShell addin, then click the Install button.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/PowerShellSupportInXamarinStudio/AddinManagerDialogWithPowerShellAddin.png" title="PowerShell addin in Addin manager dialog" alt="PowerShell addin in Addin manager dialog"></p>

</ul>


<p>More information on all the new features and changes in Xamarin Studio 6.1 can be found in the <a href="https://developer.xamarin.com/releases/studio/xamarin.studio_6.1/xamarin.studio_6.1/">release notes</a>.</p>

<h2>NuGet 3.4.3 support</h2>

<p>Xamarin Studio now includes <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/release-notes/nuget-3.4.3">NuGet 3.4.3</a> which means project.json files are now supported and NuGet packages that only support NuGet 3 or above can now be installed.</p>

<h2>Support for project.json files</h2>

<p>The project.json file is a new package file format introduced with NuGet 3 which supports transitive restore. More detailed information on project.json can be found in the <a href="https://docs.nuget.org/consume/projectjson-intro">NuGet documentation</a>.</p>

<p>A project.json file replaces the packages.config file and holds the NuGet packages
being used by the project. One difference you will notice is that the project.json file may not show the same list of NuGet packages that a packages.config file would show. This is because the project.json file only shows the NuGet packages you explicitly install into your project. So if you install say bootstrap you will only see bootstrap in the project.json file even though it depends on jQuery. If you do the same for a packages.config file you would see both bootstrap and jQuery saved in the file. Another difference is that references are not added to your project file (.csproj) when using a
project.json file.</p>

<p>In order to use a project.json file with Xamarin Studio you will need to create the file yourself in the project directory and close and re-open the solution. The project.json file needs to be
available when you open the project otherwise Xamarin Studio will default to using a packages.config file.</p>

<p>An example project.json file for a .NET 4.5 library project is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>{
  "frameworks": {
    "net45": {}
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you add a NuGet package to a project that uses a project.json file the NuGet package
information will be added into a dependencies section:</p>

<pre><code> "dependencies": {
   "NUnit": "3.2.1"
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that when using a project.json file the project will not display a From Packages directory
inside the References folder. This is because the project file does not have any
references added to it when using a project.json and the reference information is currently not available from the project system.</p>

<p>Please note that there are <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/23/changes-to-project-json/">future plans</a> to move the information stored in a project.json file into the project file.</p>

<h1>NuGet 3 package source</h1>

<p>Xamarin Studio now supports using the NuGet 3 package source:</p>

<p><a href="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json">https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json</a></p>

<p>This can be added into your package sources in Preferences. It is also the package
source that will be created by default if your global <a href="http://lastexitcode.com/projects/NuGet/FileLocations/">NuGet.Config file</a> is missing.</p>

<h2>Installing a specific NuGet package version from the Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>Older versions of Xamarin Studio supported being able to install specific package versions by using a package version search in the Add Packages dialog as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>NUnit version:*
</code></pre>

<p>This package version search was not easy to discover and so it has been removed and replaced in Xamarin Studio 6.1 with a combo box that allows a particular version to be selected. The Version combo box is in the bottom right hand corner of the Add Packages dialog as shown in the screenshots below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackagesDialog.png" title="Add Packages dialog" alt="Add Packages dialog"></p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackagesDialogWithVersionComboBoxSelected.png" title="Add Packages dialog with version combo box selected" alt="Add Packages dialog with version combo box selected"></p>

<p>Note that in order to populate the version combo box a second request is sent to the
package source so it may not show all the versions immediately.</p>

<p>Also note that for package sources which are local directories only the latest version will be displayed in the version combo box.</p>

<h2>Cancelling a NuGet operation</h2>

<p>With Xamarin Studio you can now cancel the currently running NuGet package operation. This can be done
by clicking the red Stop button in the Status Bar or in the Package Console.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/StatusBarStopButton.png" title="Status bar stop button" alt="Status bar stop button"></p>

<h2>Adding local package sources</h2>

<p>When adding a package source in Preferences it is now easier to create a package source for
a directory on your local machine. There is now a browse button which will allow you to browse to a directory and add it rather than having to type the full path into the text box.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AddPackageSourceDialog.png" title="Add Package Source dialog" alt="Add Package Source dialog"></p>

<p>The Add Package Source dialog has also been changed to make it more obvious that either a URL or a folder can be used as a package source. The URL label has been changed to Location and the placeholder text now specifies that a URL or a folder can be used.</p>

<h2>Forced NuGet package removal</h2>

<p>A NuGet package can now be removed when it not restored and is unavailable from all package sources.</p>

<p>With older versions of Xamarin Studio a NuGet package must be restored before it can be
removed. This is a requirement of NuGet since it requires the original NuGet package to work out what has been installed so it can determine what needs to be uninstalled. NuGet can do more than just update the project file with references and MSBuild .targets files, it may add new files to the project or it may run app.config or web.config transforms.</p>

<p>When the NuGet package removal fails because the NuGet package cannot be restored a dialog will be
displayed asking whether you want to try to remove the NuGet package anyway. If the OK button is selected
then Xamarin Studio will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the NuGet package from the packages.config file.</li>
<li>Remove any assembly references for the NuGet package from the project file (.csproj).</li>
<li>Remove any Imports that refer to .targets or .props files that were included with that NuGet package.</li>
</ol>


<p>This process may miss files that were added to the project by NuGet but in the majority of cases it should remove the NuGet package successfully without having to manually remove the NuGet package information from the project file.</p>

<h2>Packages installed in solution are no longer shown in Add Packages dialog</h2>

<p>With previous versions of Xamarin Studio all packages installed in the solution were shown first in the list of packages in the Add Packages dialog. Packages installed in the solution are now no longer shown in the Add Packages dialog.</p>

<h2>Only global package sources shown in Preferences</h2>

<p>The package sources shown in the Preferences dialog are now only read from the global NuGet config file. Per-solution NuGet.Config files located in individual solution directories are no longer read when showing the package sources in Preferences. This is because changes made in Preferences only modifies the global NuGet.Config file.</p>

<p>The package sources shown in the Add packages dialog will still include package sources defined in a solution&rsquo;s NuGet.Config file and is unaffected by this change.</p>

<h2>NuGet version displayed in About dialog</h2>

<p>The version of NuGet supported by Xamarin Studio is now displayed in the About dialog when the Show Details button is selected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/NuGetSupportInXamarinStudio6-1/AboutDialog.png" title="About dialog" alt="About dialog"></p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild  .targets files were not always added to the end of the project</strong></p>

<p>When installing a NuGet package that has a .targets file the Import element created was grouped with the existing Import elements. This is OK most of the time however if there are other items in the project added after the import then any build targets may fail since these items are included after the import. One example is the netfx-System.StringResources NuGet package which may not find any resource files that occur in the project after its Import element.</p>

<p>Now .targets files are added as the last element in the project file. This also makes the behaviour consistent with how NuGet works in Visual Studio.</p>

<p><strong>Custom MSBuild .props files were not added to the start of the project</strong></p>

<p>Installing a NuGet package that included an MSBuild .props file would add an Import element for the .props file at the end of the project file which is incorrect. Now .props files are added to the project file as the first child element inside the Project&rsquo;s root element.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p><strong>Offline package restore</strong></p>

<p>Package restore may not work when you are offline
even though the NuGet packages may be available in the local NuGet cache on your machine.</p>

<p>The current workaround is to create a package source that
points to a local directory containing all the required NuGet packages and disable all online
NuGet package sources. With just the local package source enabled you can then restore the NuGet packages when you are
offline. Note that this problem also affects Visual Studio 2015.</p>
