Whitespace
==========
Whitespace is a minimal and responsive theme for [Octopress](http://octopress.org). This theme lets your contents take the center stage of your blog.


Demos
-----

Unmodified: [Lucas Lew's blog](http://lucaslew.com).

Slightly customized: [Chymeric Tutorials](http://chymeric.eu), [Yous' Blog](http://yous.be/)

*If you are using whitespace and would like to showcase your website, we would be very happy to add you to the list! Just tell us your URL via the issue tracking system!*


Install
-------
    $ cd octopress
    $ git clone git://github.com/lucaslew/whitespace.git .themes/whitespace
    $ rake install['whitespace']
    $ rake generate


Update
------
    $ cd octopress/.themes/whitespace
    $ git pull
    $ rake install['whitespace']
    $ rake generate


Update and Keep Customizations
------------------------------
*For this to work, you have to track your website theme customizations on a remote (we call it ```mywebsiterepo```).*

    $ cd octopress/.themes/whitespace
    $ git pull
    $ rake install['whitespace']
    $ cd ../..
    $ git fetch --all
    $ git reset --hard mywebsiterepo/master
    $ rake generate


Comment System
--------------
Added support for open-source [Juvia](https://github.com/phusion/juvia) comment system. It requires two extra parameters in `_config.yml`: `juvia_site_key` and `juvia_host`.


Navigation Bar
--------------
You can add several icons to the navigation bar. Just set some parameters in `_config.yml`:

- `googleplus_user` with `googleplus_hidden: false` for Google+ profile.
- `pinboard_user` for Pinboard bookmarks.
- `delicious_user` for Delicious bookmarks.
- `github_user` with `github_show_profile_link: true` for GitHub profile.
- `bitbucket_user` for Bitbucket profile.


External URL
------------
You can write a [Linklog](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog) by using this theme. To publish a linked post, just add `external-url` variable in the YAML front matter of your post.

    ---
    layout: post
    ...
    external-url: http://example.com/some/external/url
    ---

Then the title will have '&rarr;' at the end. Also the title link will point to the external url.
