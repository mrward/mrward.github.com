  - Target Summary
     - Target name
     - Source filename

     - Time taken
     - Percentage of total time taken
  - Task Summary

The Build tab shows the run times of the targets and tasks, and whether they ran successfully.

Skipped tasks and targets are shown in light grey text.

Selecting a tree node in the Build tab will show more information about that node in the Properties window.
