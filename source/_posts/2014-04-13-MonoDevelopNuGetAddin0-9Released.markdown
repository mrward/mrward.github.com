A new version of the NuGet addin for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop has been released.

## New Features

The main change is to include [NuGet 2.8.1](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-2.8.1) which adds support for Windows Phone 8.1 projects. 
Also some of the newer NuGet packages, such as Microsoft.Bcl.Immutable 1.1.20-beta, which the [Roslyn NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.CodeAnalysis) depend on, will not install unless NuGet 2.8.1 is being used.

For a detailed look at the changes please read the [release note](/projects/MonoDevelopNuGetAddin/Releases/0.9/).
