A new version of the NuGet addin for Xamarin Studio and MonoDevelop has been released.

## New Features

The main change is support for [NuGet 2.7.2](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-2.7.2) so you can now add NuGet packages, that include Portable Class Libraries (PCLs), to projects that target MonoAndroid.

For a detailed look at the changes please read the [release note](/projects/MonoDevelopNuGetAddin/Releases/0.8/).
